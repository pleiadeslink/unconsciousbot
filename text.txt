The hypothesis of a collective unconscious belongs to the class of ideas that people at first find strange but soon come to possess and use as familiar conceptionsThis has been the case with the concept of the unconscious in generalAfter the philosophical idea of the unconscious, in the form presented chiefly by Carus and von Hartmann, had gone down under the overwhelming wave of materialism and empiricism, leaving hardly a ripple behind it, it gradually reappeared in the scientific domain of medical psychology.
At first the concept of the unconscious was limited to denoting the state of repressed or forgotten contentsEven with Freud, who makes the unconscious—at least metaphorically—take the stage as the acting subject, it is really nothing but the gathering place of forgotten and repressed contents, and has a functional significance thanks only to theseFor Freud, accordingly, the unconscious is of an exclusively personal nature, although he was aware of its archaic and mythological thought-forms.
A more or less superficial layer of the unconscious is undoubtedly personalI call it the personal unconsciousBut this personal unconscious rests upon a deeper layer, which does not derive from personal experience and is not a personal acquisition but is inbornThis deeper layer I call the collective unconsciousI have chosen the term collective because this part of the unconscious is not individual but universal; in contrast to the personal psyche, it has contents and modes of behaviour that are more or less the same everywhere and in all individualsIt is, in other words, identical in all men and thus constitutes a common psychic substrate of a suprapersonal nature which is present in every one of us.
Psychic existence can be recognized only by the presence of contents that are capable of consciousnessWe can therefore speak of an unconscious only in so far as we are able to demonstrate its contentsThe contents of the personal unconscious are chiefly the feeling-toned complexes, as they are called; they constitute the personal and private side of psychic lifeThe contents of the collective unconscious, on the other hand, are known as archetypes.
The term archetype occurs as early as Philo Judaeus, with reference to the Imago Dei (God-image) in manIt can also be found in Irenaeus, who says: The creator of the world did not fashion these things directly from himself but copied them from archetypes outside himself. In the Corpus Hermeticum, God is called τò άρχέτυπov φώς (archetypal light)The term occurs several times in Dionysius the Areopagite, as for instance in De caelesti hierarchia, II, : immaterial Archetypes, and in De divinis nominibus, I, : Archetypal stone. The term archetype is not found in StAugustine, but the idea of it isThus in De diversis quaestionibus LXXXIII he speaks of ideae principales, which are themselves not formed … but are contained in the divine understanding.' Archetype is an explanatory paraphrase of the Platonic For our purposes this term is apposite and helpful, because it tells us that so far as the collective unconscious contents are concerned we are dealing with archaic or—I would say—primordial types, that is, with universal images that have existed since the remotest timesThe term représentations collectives, used by Lévy-Bruhl to denote the symbolic figures in the primitive view of the world, could easily be applied to unconscious contents as well, since it means practically the same thingPrimitive tribal lore is concerned with archetypes that have been modified in a special wayThey are no longer contents of the unconscious, but have already been changed into conscious formulae taught according to tradition, generally in the form of esoteric teachingThis last is a typical means of expression for the transmission of collective contents originally derived from the unconscious.
Another well-known expression of the archetypes is myth and fairytaleBut here too we are dealing with forms that have received a specific stamp and have been handed down through long periods of timeThe term archetype thus applies only indirectly to the représentations collectives, since it designates only those psychic contents which have not yet been submitted to conscious elaboration and are therefore an immediate datum of psychic experienceIn this sense there is a considerable difference between the archetype and the historical formula that has evolvedEspecially on the higher levels of esoteric teaching the archetypes appear in a form that reveals quite unmistakably the critical and evaluating influence of conscious elaborationTheir immediate manifestation, as we encounter it in dreams and visions, is much more individual, less understandable, and more naïve than in myths, for exampleThe archetype is essentially an unconscious content that is altered by becoming conscious and by being perceived, and it takes its colour from the individual consciousness in which it happens to appear.
What the word archetype means in the nominal sense is clear enough, then, from its relations with myth, esoteric teaching, and fairytaleBut if we try to establish what an archetype is psychologically, the matter becomes more complicatedSo far mythologists have always helped themselves out with solar, lunar, meteorological, vegetal, and other ideas of the kindThe fact that myths are first and foremost psychic phenomena that reveal the nature of the soul is something they have absolutely refused to see until nowPrimitive man is not much interested in objective explanations of the obvious, but he has an imperative need—or rather, his unconscious psyche has an irresistible urge—to assimilate all outer sense experiences to inner, psychic eventsIt is not enough for the primitive to see the sun rise and set; this external observation must at the same time be a psychic happening: the sun in its course must represent the fate of a god or hero who, in the last analysis, dwells nowhere except in the soul of manAll the mythologized processes of nature, such as summer and winter, the phases of the moon, the rainy seasons, and so forth, are in no sense allegories of these objective occurrences; rather they are symbolic expressions of the inner, unconscious drama of the psyche which becomes accessible to man's consciousness by way of projection—that is, mirrored in the events of natureThe projection is so fundamental that it has taken several thousand years of civilization to detach it in some measure from its outer objectIn the case of astrology, for instance, this age-old scientia intuitiva came to be branded as rank heresy because man had not yet succeeded in making the psychological description of character independent of the starsEven today, people who still believe in astrology fall almost without exception for the old superstitious assumption of the influence of the starsAnd yet anyone who can calculate a horoscope should know that, since the days of Hipparchus of Alexandria, the spring-point has been fixed at o° Aries, and that the zodiac on which every horoscope is based is therefore quite arbitrary, the spring-point having gradually advanced, since then, into the first degrees of Pisces, owing to the precession of the equinoxes.
Primitive man impresses us so strongly with his subjectivity that we should really have guessed long ago that myths refer to something psychicHis knowledge of nature is essentially the language and outer dress of an unconscious psychic processBut the very fact that this process is unconscious gives us the reason why man has thought of everything except the psyche in his attempts to explain mythsHe simply didn't know that the psyche contains all the images that have ever given rise to myths, and that our unconscious is an acting and suffering subject with an inner drama which primitive man rediscovers, by means of analogy, in the processes of nature both great and small.
The stars of thine own fate lie in thy breast, says Seni to Wallenstein—a dictum that should satisfy all astrologers if we knew even a little about the secrets of the heartBut for this, so far, men have had little understandingNor would I dare to assert that things are any better today.
Tribal lore is always sacred and dangerousAll esoteric teachings seek to apprehend the unseen happenings in the psyche, and all claim supreme authority for themselvesWhat is true of primitive lore is true in even higher degree of the ruling world religionsThey contain a revealed knowledge that was originally hidden, and they set forth the secrets of the soul in glorious imagesTheir temples and their sacred writings proclaim in image and word the doctrine hallowed from of old, making it accessible to every believing heart, every sensitive vision, every farthest range of thoughtIndeed, we are compelled to say that the more beautiful, the more sublime, the more comprehensive the image that has evolved and been handed down by tradition, the further removed it is from individual experienceWe can just feel our way into it and sense something of it, but the original experience has been lost.
Why is psychology the youngest of the empirical sciences? Why have we not long since discovered the unconscious and raised up its treasure-house of eternal images? Simply because we had a religious formula for everything psychic—and one that is far more beautiful and comprehensive than immediate experienceThough the Christian view of the world has paled for many people, the symbolic treasure-rooms of the East are still full of marvels that can nourish for a long time to come the passion for show and new clothesWhat is more, these images—be they Christian or Buddhist or what you will—are lovely, mysterious, richly intuitiveNaturally, the more familiar we are with them the more does constant usage polish them smooth, so that what remains is only banal superficiality and meaningless paradoxThe mystery of the Virgin Birth, or the homoousia of the Son with the Father, or the Trinity which is nevertheless not a triad—these no longer lend wings to any philosophical fancyThey have stiffened into mere objects of beliefSo it is not surprising if the religious need, the believing mind, and the philosophical speculations of the educated European are attracted by the symbols of the East—those grandiose conceptions of divinity in India and the abysms of Taoist philosophy in China—just as once before the heart and mind of the men of antiquity were gripped by Christian ideasThere are many Europeans who began by surrendering completely to the influence of the Christian symbol until they landed themselves in a Kierkegaardian neurosis, or whose relation to God, owing to the progressive impoverishment of symbolism, developed into an unbearably sophisticated I-You relationship—only to fall victims in their turn to the magic and novelty of Eastern symbolsThis surrender is not necessarily a defeat; rather it proves the receptiveness and vitality of the religious senseWe can observe much the same thing in the educated Oriental, who not infrequently feels drawn to the Christian symbol or to the science that is so unsuited to the Oriental mind, and even develops an enviable understanding of themThat people should succumb to these eternal images is entirely normal, in fact it is what these images are forThey are meant to attract, to convince, to fascinate, and to overpowerThey are created out of the primal stuff of revelation and reflect the ever-unique experience of divinityThat is why they always give man a premonition of the divine while at the same time safeguarding him from immediate experience of itThanks to the labours of the human spirit over the centuries, these images have become embedded in a comprehensive system of thought that ascribes an order to the world, and are at the same time represented by a mighty, far-spread, and venerable institution called the Church.
I can best illustrate my meaning by taking as an example the Swiss mystic and hermit, Brother Nicholas of Flüe, who has recently been canonizedProbably his most important religious experience was the so-called Trinity Vision, which preoccupied him to such an extent that he painted it, or had it painted, on the wall of his cellThe painting is still preserved in the parish church at SachselnIt is a mandala divided into six parts, and in the centre is the crowned countenance of GodNow we know that Brother Klaus investigated the nature of his vision with the help of an illustrated devotional booklet by a German mystic, and that he struggled to get his original experience into a form he could understandHe occupied himself with it for yearsThis is what I call the elaboration of the symbolHis reflections on the nature of the vision, influenced as they were by the mystic diagrams he used as a guiding thread, inevitably led him to the conclusion that he must have gazed upon the Holy Trinity itself—the summum bonum, eternal loveThis is borne out by the expurgated version now in Sachseln.
The original experience, however, was entirely differentIn his ecstasy there was revealed to Brother Klaus a sight so terrible that his own countenance was changed by it—so much so, indeed, that people were terrified and felt afraid of himWhat he had seen was a vision of the utmost intensityWoelflin, our oldest source, writes as follows:
All who came to him were filled with terror at the first glanceAs to the cause of this, he himself used to say that he had seen a piercing light resembling a human faceAt the sight of it he feared that his heart would burst into little piecesTherefore, overcome with terror, he instantly turned his face away and fell to the groundAnd that was the reason why his face was now terrible to others.
This vision has rightly been compared with the one in Revelation  : ff., that strange apocalyptic Christ-image, which for sheer gruesomeness and singularity is surpassed only by the monstrous seven-eyed lamb with seven horns (Rev : f.)It is certainly very difficult to see what is the relationship between this figure and the Christ of the gospelsHence Brother Klaus's vision was interpreted in a quite definite way by the earliest sourcesIn , the humanist Karl Bovillus (Charles de Bouelles) wrote to a friend:
I wish to tell you of a vision which appeared to him in the sky, on a night when the stars were shining and he stood in prayer and contemplationHe saw the head of a human figure with a terrifying face, full of wrath and threats.
This interpretation agrees perfectly with the modern amplification furnished by Revelation  : Nor should we forget Brother Klaus's other visions, for instance, of Christ in the bearskin, of God the Father and God the Mother, and of himself as the SonThey exhibit features which are very undogmatic indeed.
Traditionally this great vision was brought into connection with the Trinity picture in the church at Sachseln, and so, likewise, was the wheel symbolism in the so-called Pilgrim's Tract. Brother Klaus, we are told, showed the picture of the wheel to a visiting pilgrimEvidently this picture had preoccupied him for some timeBlanke is of the opinion that, contrary to tradition, there is no connection between the vision and the Trinity pictureThis scepticism seems to me to go too farThere must have been some reason for Brother Klaus's interest in the wheelVisions like the one he had often cause mental confusion and disintegration (witness the heart bursting into little pieces)We know from experience that the protective circle, the mandala, is the traditional antidote for chaotic states of mindIt is therefore only too clear why Brother Klaus was fascinated by the symbol of the wheelThe interpretation of the terrifying vision as an experience of God need not be so wide of the mark eitherThe connection between the great vision and the Trinity picture, and of both with the wheel-symbol, therefore seems to me very probable on psychological grounds.
This vision, undoubtedly fearful and highly perturbing, which burst like a volcano upon his religious view of the world, without any dogmatic prelude and without exegetical commentary, naturally needed a long labour of assimilation in order to fit it into the total structure of the psyche and thus restore the disturbed psychic balanceBrother Klaus came to terms with his experience on the basis of dogma, then firm as a rock; and the dogma proved its powers of assimilation by turning something horribly alive into the beautiful abstraction of the Trinity ideaBut the reconciliation might have taken place on a quite different basis provided by the vision itself and its unearthly actuality—much to the disadvantage of the Christian conception of God and no doubt to the still greater disadvantage of Brother Klaus himself, who would then have become not a saint but a heretic (if not a lunatic) and would probably have ended his life at the stake.
This example demonstrates the use of the dogmatic symbol: it formulates a tremendous and dangerously decisive psychic experience, fittingly called an experience of the Divine, in a way that is tolerable to our human understanding, without either limiting the scope of the experience or doing damage to its overwhelming significanceThe vision of divine wrath, which we also meet in Jakob Böhme, ill accords with the God of the New Testament, the loving Father in heaven, and for this reason it might easily have become the source of an inner conflictThat would have been quite in keeping with the spirit of the age—the end of the fifteenth century, the time of Nicholas Cusanus, whose formula of the complexio oppositorum actually anticipated the schism that was imminentNot long afterwards the Yahwistic conception of God went through a series of rebirths in ProtestantismYahweh is a God-concept that contains the opposites in a still undivided state.
Brother Klaus put himself outside the beaten track of convention and habit by leaving his home and family, living alone for years, and gazing deep into the dark mirror, so that the wondrous and terrible boon of original experience befell himIn this situation the dogmatic image of divinity that had been developed over the centuries worked like a healing draughtIt helped him to assimilate the fatal incursion of an archetypal image and so escape being torn asunderAngelus Silesius was not so fortunate; the inner conflict tore him to pieces, because in his day the stability of the Church that dogma guarantees was already shattered.
Jakob Böhme, too, knew a God of the Wrath-fire, a real Deus absconditusHe was able to bridge the profound and agonizing contradiction on the one hand by means of the Christian formula of Father and Son and embody it speculatively in his view of the world—which, though Gnostic, was in all essential points ChristianOtherwise he would have become a dualistOn the other hand it was undoubtedly alchemy, long brewing the union of opposites in secret, that came to his aidNevertheless the opposition has left obvious traces in the mandala appended to his XL Questions concerning the Soule, showing the nature of the divinityThe mandala is divided into a dark and a light half, and the semicircles that are drawn round them, instead of joining up to form a ring, are turned back to back.
Dogma takes the place of the collective unconscious by formulating its contents on a grand scaleThe Catholic way of life is completely unaware of psychological problems in this senseAlmost the entire life of the collective unconscious has been channelled into the dogmatic archetypal ideas and flows along like a well-controlled stream in the symbolism of creed and ritualIt manifests itself in the inwardness of the Catholic psycheThe collective unconscious, as we understand it today, was never a matter of psychology, for before the Christian Church existed there were the antique mysteries, and these reach back into the grey mists of neolithic prehistoryMankind has never lacked powerful images to lend magical aid against all the uncanny things that live in the depths of the psycheAlways the figures of the unconscious were expressed in protecting and healing images and in this way were expelled from the psyche into cosmic space.
The iconoclasm of the Reformation, however, quite literally made a breach in the protective wall of sacred images, and since then one image after another has crumbled awayThey became dubious, for they conflicted with awakening reasonBesides, people had long since forgotten what they meantOr had they really forgotten? Could it be that men had never really known what they meant, and that only in recent times did it occur to the Protestant part of mankind that actually we haven't the remotest conception of what is meant by the Virgin Birth, the divinity of Christ, and the complexities of the Trinity? It almost seems as if these images had just lived, and as if their living existence had simply been accepted without question and without reflection, much as everyone decorates Christmas trees or hides Easter eggs without ever knowing what these customs meanThe fact is that archetypal images are so packed with meaning in themselves that people never think of asking what they really do meanThat the gods die from time to time is due to man's sudden discovery that they do not mean anything, that they are made by human hands, useless idols of wood and stoneIn reality, however, he has merely discovered that up till then he has never thought about his images at allAnd when he starts thinking about them, he does so with the help of what he calls reason—which in point of fact is nothing more than the sum-total of all his prejudices and myopic views.
The history of Protestantism has been one of chronic iconoclasmOne wall after another fellAnd the work of destruction was not too difficult once the authority of the Church had been shatteredWe all know how, in large things as in small, in general as well as in particular, piece after piece collapsed, and how the alarming poverty of symbols that is now the condition of our life came aboutWith that the power of the Church has vanished too—a fortress robbed of its bastions and casemates, a house whose walls have been plucked away, exposed to all the winds of the world and to all dangers.
Although this is, properly speaking, a lamentable collapse that offends our sense of history, the disintegration of Protestantism into nearly four hundred denominations is yet a sure sign that the restlessness continuesThe Protestant is cast out into a state of defencelessness that might well make the natural man shudderHis enlightened consciousness, of course, refuses to take cognizance of this fact, and is quietly looking elsewhere for what has been lost to EuropeWe seek the effective images, the thought-forms that satisfy the restlessness of heart and mind, and we find the treasures of the East.
There is no objection to this, in and for itselfNobody forced the Romans to import Asiatic cults in bulkIf Christianity had really been—as so often described—alien to the Germanic tribes, they could easily have rejected it when the prestige of the Roman legions began to waneBut Christianity had come to stay, because it fits in with the existing archetypal patternIn the course of the centuries, however, it turned into something its founder might well have wondered at had he lived to see it; and the Christianity of Negroes and other dark-skinned converts is certainly an occasion for historical reflectionsWhy, then, should the West not assimilate Eastern forms? The Romans too went to Eleusis, Samothrace, and Egypt in order to get themselves initiatedIn Egypt there even seems to have been a regular tourist trade in this commodity.
The gods of Greece and Rome perished from the same disease as did our Christian symbols: people discovered then, as today, that they had no thoughts whatever on the subjectOn the other hand, the gods of the strangers still had unexhausted manaTheir names were weird and incomprehensible and their deeds portentously dark—something altogether different from the hackneyed chronique scandaleuse of OlympusAt least one couldn't understand the Asiatic symbols, and for this reason they were not banal like the conventional godsThe fact that people accepted the new as unthinkingly as they had rejected the old did not become a problem at that time.
Is it becoming a problem today? Shall we be able to put on, like a new suit of clothes, ready-made symbols grown on foreign soil, saturated with foreign blood, spoken in a foreign tongue, nourished by a foreign culture, interwoven with foreign history, and so resemble a beggar who wraps himself in kingly raiment, a king who disguises himself as a beggar? No doubt this is possibleOr is there something in ourselves that commands us to go in for no mummeries, but perhaps even to sew our garment ourselves?
I am convinced that the growing impoverishment of symbols has a meaningIt is a development that has an inner consistencyEverything that we have not thought about, and that has therefore been deprived of a meaningful connection with our developing consciousness, has got lostIf we now try to cover our nakedness with the gorgeous trappings of the East, as the theosophists do, we would be playing our own history falseA man does not sink down to beggary only to pose afterwards as an Indian potentateIt seems to me that it would be far better stoutly to avow our spiritual poverty, our symbol-lessness, instead of feigning a legacy to which we are not the legitimate heirs at allWe are, surely, the rightful heirs of Christian symbolism, but somehow we have squandered this heritageWe have let the house our fathers built fall into decay, and now we try to break into Oriental palaces that our fathers never knewAnyone who has lost the historical symbols and cannot be satisfied with substitutes is certainly in a very difficult position today: before him there yawns the void, and he turns away from it in horrorWhat is worse, the vacuum gets filled with absurd political and social ideas, which one and all are distinguished by their spiritual bleaknessBut if he cannot get along with these pedantic dogmatisms, he sees himself forced to be serious for once with his alleged trust in God, though it usually turns out that his fear of things going wrong if he did so is even more persuasiveThis fear is far from unjustified, for where God is closest the danger seems greatestIt is dangerous to avow spiritual poverty, for the poor man has desires, and whoever has desires calls down some fatality on himselfA Swiss proverb puts it drastically: Behind every rich man stands a devil, and behind every poor man two.
Just as in Christianity the vow of worldly poverty turned the mind away from the riches of this earth, so spiritual poverty seeks to renounce the false riches of the spirit in order to withdraw not only from the sorry remnants—which today call themselves the Protestant church—of a great past, but also from all the allurements of the odorous East; in order, finally, to dwell with itself alone, where, in the cold light of consciousness, the blank barrenness of the world reaches to the very stars.
We have inherited this poverty from our fathersI well remember the confirmation lessons I received at the hands of my own fatherThe catechism bored me unspeakablyOne day I was turning over the pages of my little book, in the hope of finding something interesting, when my eye fell on the paragraphs about the TrinityThis interested me at once, and I waited impatiently for the lessons to get to that sectionBut when the longed-for lesson arrived, my father said: We'll skip this bit; I can't make head or tail of it myself. With that my last hope was laid in the graveI admired my father's honesty, but this did not alter the fact that from then on all talk of religion bored me to death.
Our intellect has achieved the most tremendous things, but in the meantime our spiritual dwelling has fallen into disrepairWe are absolutely convinced that even with the aid of the latest and largest reflecting telescope, now being built in America, men will discover behind the farthest nebulae no fiery empyrean; and we know that our eyes will wander despairingly through the dead emptiness of interstellar spaceNor is it any better when mathematical physics reveals to us the world of the infinitely smallIn the end we dig up the wisdom of all ages and peoples, only to find that everything most dear and precious to us has already been said in the most superb languageLike greedy children we stretch out our hands and think that, if only we could grasp it, we would possess it tooBut what we possess is no longer valid, and our hands grow weary from the grasping, for riches lie everywhere, as far as the eye can reachAll these possessions turn to water, and more than one sorcerer's apprentice has been drowned in the waters called up by himself—if he did not first succumb to the saving delusion that this wisdom was good and that was badIt is from these adepts that there come those terrifying invalids who think they have a prophetic missionFor the artificial sundering of true and false wisdom creates a tension in the psyche, and from this there arises a loneliness and a craving like that of the morphine addict, who always hopes to find companions in his vice.
When our natural inheritance has been dissipated, then the spirit too, as Heraclitus says, has descended from its fiery heightsBut when spirit becomes heavy it turns to water, and with Luciferian presumption the intellect usurps the seat where once the spirit was enthronedThe spirit may legitimately claim the patria potestas over the soul; not so the earth-born intellect, which is man's sword or hammer, and not a creator of spiritual worlds, a father of the soulHence Ludwig Klages and Max Scheler were moderate enough in their attempts to rehabilitate the spirit, for both were children of an age in which the spirit was no longer up above but down below, no longer fire but water.
Therefore the way of the soul in search of its lost father—like Sophia seeking Bythos—leads to the water, to the dark mirror that reposes at its bottomWhoever has elected for the state of spiritual poverty, the true heritage of Protestantism carried to its logical conclusion, goes the way of the soul that leads to the waterThis water is no figure of speech, but a living symbol of the dark psycheI can best illustrate this by a concrete example, one out of many:
A Protestant theologian often dreamed the same dream: He stood on a mountain slope with a deep valley below, and in it a dark lakeHe knew in the dream that something had always prevented him from approaching the lakeThis time he resolved to go to the waterAs he approached the shore, everything grew dark and uncanny, and a gust of wind suddenly rushed over the face of the waterHe was seized by a panic fear, and awoke.
This dream shows us the natural symbolismThe dreamer descends into his own depths, and the way leads him to the mysterious waterAnd now there occurs the miracle of the pool of Bethesda: an angel comes down and touches the water, endowing it with healing powerIn the dream it is the wind, the pneuma, which bloweth where it listethMan's descent to the water is needed in order to evoke the miracle of its coming to lifeBut the breath of the spirit rushing over the dark water is uncanny, like everything whose cause we do not know—since it is not ourselvesIt hints at an unseen presence, a numen to which neither human expectations nor the machinations of the will have given lifeIt lives of itself, and a shudder runs through the man who thought that spirit was merely what he believes, what he makes himself, what is said in books, or what people talk aboutBut when it happens spontaneously it is a spookish thing, and primitive fear seizes the naïve mindThe elders of the Elgonyi tribe in Kenya gave me exactly the same description of the nocturnal god whom they call the maker of fear. He comes to you, they said, like a cold gust of wind, and you shudder, or he goes whistling round in the tall grass—an African Pan who glides among the reeds in the haunted noontide hour, playing on his pipes and frightening the shepherds.
Thus, in the dream, the breath of the pneuma frightened another pastor, a shepherd of the flock, who in the darkness of the night trod the reed-grown shore in the deep valley of the psycheYes, that erstwhile fiery spirit has made a descent to the realm of nature, to the trees and rocks and the waters of the psyche, like the old man in Nietzsche's Zarathustra, who, wearied of humankind, withdrew into the forest to growl with the bears in honour of the Creator.
We must surely go the way of the waters, which always tend downward, if we would raise up the treasure, the precious heritage of the fatherIn the Gnostic hymn to the soul, the son is sent forth by his parents to seek the pearl that fell from the King's crownIt lies at the bottom of a deep well, guarded by a dragon, in the land of the Egyptians—that land of fleshpots and drunkenness with all its material and spiritual richesThe son and heir sets out to fetch the jewel, but forgets himself and his task in the orgies of Egyptian worldliness, until a letter from his father reminds him what his duty isHe then sets out for the water and plunges into the dark depths of the well, where he finds the pearl on the bottom, and in the end offers it to the highest divinity.
This hymn, ascribed to Bardesanes, dates from an age that resembled ours in more than one respectMankind looked and waited, and it was a fish—levatus de profundo (drawn from the deep)—that became the symbol of the saviour, the bringer of healing.
As I wrote these lines, I received a letter from Vancouver, from a person unknown to meThe writer is puzzled by his dreams, which are always about water: Almost every time I dream it is about water: either I am having a bath, or the water-closet is overflowing, or a pipe is bursting, or my home has drifted down to the water's edge, or I see an acquaintance about to sink into water, or I am trying to get out of water, or I am having a bath and the tub is about to overflow, etc.
Water is the commonest symbol for the unconsciousThe lake in the valley is the unconscious, which lies, as it were, underneath consciousness, so that it is often referred to as the subconscious, usually with the pejorative connotation of an inferior consciousnessWater is the valley spirit, the water dragon of Tao, whose nature resembles water—a yang embraced in the yinPsychologically, therefore, water means spirit that has become unconsciousSo the dream of the theologian is quite right in telling him that down by the water he could experience the working of the living spirit like a miracle of healing in the pool of BethesdaThe descent into the depths always seems to precede the ascentThus another theologian dreamed that he saw on a mountain a kind of Castle of the GrailHe went along a road that seemed to lead straight to the foot of the mountain and up itBut as he drew nearer he discovered to his great disappointment that a chasm separated him from the mountain, a deep, darksome gorge with underworldly water rushing along the bottomA steep path led downwards and toilsomely climbed up again on the other sideBut the prospect looked uninviting, and the dreamer awokeHere again the dreamer, thirsting for the shining heights, had first to descend into the dark depths, and this proves to be the indispensable condition for climbing any higherThe prudent man avoids the danger lurking in these depths, but he also throws away the good which a bold but imprudent venture might bring.
The statement made by the dream meets with violent resistance from the conscious mind, which knows spirit only as something to be found in the heightsSpirit always seems to come from above, while from below comes everything that is sordid and worthlessFor people who think in this way, spirit means highest freedom, a soaring over the depths, deliverance from the prison of the chthonic world, and hence a refuge for all those timorous souls who do not want to become anything differentBut water is earthy and tangible, it is also the fluid of the instinct-driven body, blood and the flowing of blood, the odour of the beast, carnality heavy with passionThe unconscious is the psyche that reaches down from the daylight of mentally and morally lucid consciousness into the nervous system that for ages has been known as the sympathetic. This does not govern perception and muscular activity like the cerebrospinal system, and thus control the environment; but, though functioning without sense-organs, it maintains the balance of life and, through the mysterious paths of sympathetic excitation, not only gives us knowledge of the innermost life of other beings but also has an inner effect upon themIn this sense it is an extremely collective system, the operative basis of all participation mystique, whereas the cerebrospinal function reaches its high point in separating off the specific qualities of the ego, and only apprehends surfaces and externals—always through the medium of spaceIt experiences everything as an outside, whereas the sympathetic system experiences everything as an inside.
The unconscious is commonly regarded as a sort of incapsulated fragment of our most personal and intimate life—something like what the Bible calls the heart and considers the source of all evil thoughtsIn the chambers of the heart dwell the wicked blood-spirits, swift anger and sensual weaknessThis is how the unconscious looks when seen from the conscious sideBut consciousness appears to be essentially an affair of the cerebrum, which sees everything separately and in isolation, and therefore sees the unconscious in this way too, regarding it outright as my unconsciousHence it is generally believed that anyone who descends into the unconscious gets into a suffocating atmosphere of egocentric subjectivity, and in this blind alley is exposed to the attack of all the ferocious beasts which the caverns of the psychic underworld are supposed to harbour.
True, whoever looks into the mirror of the water will see first of all his own faceWhoever goes to himself risks a confrontation with himselfThe mirror does not flatter, it faithfully shows whatever looks into it; namely, the face we never show to the world because we cover it with the persona, the mask of the actorBut the mirror lies behind the mask and shows the true face.
This confrontation is the first test of courage on the inner way, a test sufficient to frighten off most people, for the meeting with ourselves belongs to the more unpleasant things that can be avoided so long as we can project everything negative into the environmentBut if we are able to see our own shadow and can bear knowing about it, then a small part of the problem has already been solved: we have at least brought up the personal unconsciousThe shadow is a living part of the personality and therefore wants to live with it in some formIt cannot be argued out of existence or rationalized into harmlessnessThis problem is exceedingly difficult, because it not only challenges the whole man, but reminds him at the same time of his helplessness and ineffectualityStrong natures—or should one rather call them weak?—do not like to be reminded of this, but prefer to think of themselves as heroes who are beyond good and evil, and to cut the Gordian knot instead of untying itNevertheless, the account has to be settled sooner or laterIn the end one has to admit that there are problems which one simply cannot solve on one's own resourcesSuch an admission has the advantage of being honest, truthful, and in accord with reality, and this prepares the ground for a compensatory reaction from the collective unconscious: you are now more inclined to give heed to a helpful idea or intuition, or to notice thoughts which had not been allowed to voice themselves beforePerhaps you will pay attention to the dreams that visit you at such moments, or will reflect on certain inner and outer occurrences that take place just at this timeIf you have an attitude of this kind, then the helpful powers slumbering in the deeper strata of man's nature can come awake and intervene, for helplessness and weakness are the eternal experience and the eternal problem of mankindTo this problem there is also an eternal answer, otherwise it would have been all up with humanity long agoWhen you have done everything that could possibly be done, the only thing that remains is what you could still do if only you knew itBut how much do we know of ourselves? Precious little, to judge by experienceHence there is still a great deal of room left for the unconsciousPrayer, as we know, calls for a very similar attitude and therefore has much the same effect.
The necessary and needful reaction from the collective unconscious expresses itself in archetypally formed ideasThe meeting with oneself is, at first, the meeting with one's own shadowThe shadow is a tight passage, a narrow door, whose painful constriction no one is spared who goes down to the deep wellBut one must learn to know oneself in order to know who one isFor what comes after the door is, surprisingly enough, a boundless expanse full of unprecedented uncertainty, with apparently no inside and no outside, no above and no below, no here and no there, no mine and no thine, no good and no badIt is the world of water, where all life floats in suspension; where the realm of the sympathetic system, the soul of everything living, begins; where I am indivisibly this and that; where I experience the other in myself and the other-than-myself experiences me.
No, the collective unconscious is anything but an incapsulated personal system; it is sheer objectivity, as wide as the world and open to all the worldThere I am the object of every subject, in complete reversal of my ordinary consciousness, where I am always the subject that has an objectThere I am utterly one with the world, so much a part of it that I forget all too easily who I really amLost in oneself is a good way of describing this stateBut this self is the world, if only a consciousness could see itThat is why we must know who we are.
The unconscious no sooner touches us than we are it—we become unconscious of ourselvesThat is the age-old danger, instinctively known and feared by primitive man, who himself stands so very close to this pleromaHis consciousness is still uncertain, wobbling on its feetIt is still childish, having just emerged from the primal watersA wave of the unconscious may easily roll over it, and then he forgets who he was and does things that are strange to himHence primitives are afraid of uncontrolled emotions, because consciousness breaks down under them and gives way to possessionAll man's strivings have therefore been directed towards the consolidation of consciousnessThis was the purpose of rite and dogma; they were dams and walls to keep back the dangers of the unconscious, the perils of the soul. Primitive rites consist accordingly in the exorcizing of spirits, the lifting of spells, the averting of the evil omen, propitiation, purification, and the production by sympathetic magic of helpful occurrences.
It is these barriers, erected in primitive times, that later became the foundations of the ChurchIt is also these barriers that collapse when the symbols become weak with ageThen the waters rise and boundless catastrophes break over mankindThe religious leader of the Taos pueblo, known as the Loco Tenente Gobernador, once said to me: The Americans should stop meddling with our religion, for when it dies and we can no longer help the sun our Father to cross the sky, the Americans and the whole world will learn something in ten years' time, for then the sun won't rise any more. In other words, night will fall, the light of consciousness is extinguished, and the dark sea of the unconscious breaks in.
Whether primitive or not, mankind always stands on the brink of actions it performs itself but does not controlThe whole world wants peace and the whole world prepares for war, to take but one exampleMankind is powerless against mankind, and the gods, as ever, show it the ways of fateToday we call the gods factors, which comes from facere, to make.' The makers stand behind the wings of the world-theatreIt is so in great things as in smallIn the realm of consciousness we are our own masters; we seem to be the factors themselvesBut if we step through the door of the shadow we discover with terror that we are the objects of unseen factorsTo know this is decidedly unpleasant, for nothing is more disillusioning than the discovery of our own inadequacyIt can even give rise to primitive panic, because, instead of being believed in, the anxiously guarded supremacy of consciousness—which is in truth one of the secrets of human success—is questioned in the most dangerous wayBut since ignorance is no guarantee of security, and in fact only makes our insecurity still worse, it is probably better despite our fear to know where the danger liesTo ask the right question is already half the solution of a problemAt any rate we then know that the greatest danger threatening us comes from the unpredictability of the psyche's reactionsDiscerning persons have realized for some time that external historical conditions, of whatever kind, are only occasions, jumping-off grounds, for the real dangers that threaten our livesThese are the present politico-social delusional systemsWe should not regard them causally, as necessary consequences of external conditions, but as decisions precipitated by the collective unconscious.
This is a new problemAll ages before us have believed in gods in some form or otherOnly an unparalleled impoverishment of symbolism could enable us to rediscover the gods as psychic factors, that is, as archetypes of the unconsciousNo doubt this discovery is hardly credible at presentTo be convinced, we need to have the experience pictured in the dream of the theologian, for only then do we experience the self-activity of the spirit moving over the watersSince the stars have fallen from heaven and our highest symbols have paled, a secret life holds sway in the unconsciousThat is why we have a psychology today, and why we speak of the unconsciousAll this would be quite superfluous in an age or culture that possessed symbolsSymbols are spirit from above, and under those conditions the spirit is above tooTherefore it would be a foolish and senseless undertaking for such people to wish to experience or investigate an unconscious that contains nothing but the silent, undisturbed sway of natureOur unconscious, on the other hand, hides living water, spirit that has become nature, and that is why it is disturbedHeaven has become for us the cosmic space of the physicists, and the divine empyrean a fair memory of things that once wereBut the heart glows, and a secret unrest gnaws at the roots of our beingIn the words of the Völuspa we may ask:
Our concern with the unconscious has become a vital question for us—a question of spiritual being or non-beingAll those who have had an experience like that mentioned in the dream know that the treasure lies in the depths of the water and will try to salvage itAs they must never forget who they are, they must on no account imperil their consciousnessThey will keep their standpoint firmly anchored to the earth, and will thus—to preserve the metaphor—become fishers who catch with hook and net what swims in the waterThere may be consummate fools who do not understand what fishermen do, but the latter will not mistake the timeless meaning of their action, for the symbol of their craft is many centuries older than the still unfaded story of the GrailBut not every man is a fishermanSometimes this figure remains arrested at an early, instinctive level, and then it is an otter, as we know from Oskar Schmitz's fairytales.
Whoever looks into the water sees his own image, but behind it living creatures soon loom up; fishes, presumably, harmless dwellers of the deep—harmless, if only the lake were not hauntedThey are water-beings of a peculiar sortSometimes a nixie gets into the fisherman's net, a female, half-human fish.
The nixie is an even more instinctive version of a magical feminine being whom I call the animaShe can also be a siren, melusina (mermaid), wood-nymph, Grace, or Erlking's daughter, or a lamia or succubus, who infatuates young men and sucks the life out of themMoralizing critics will say that these figures are projections of soulful emotional states and are nothing but worthless fantasiesOne must admit that there is a certain amount of truth in thisBut is it the whole truth? Is the nixie really nothing but a product of moral laxity? Were there not such beings long ago, in an age when dawning human consciousness was still wholly bound to nature? Surely there were spirits of forest, field, and stream long before the question of moral conscience ever existedWhat is more, these beings were as much dreaded as adored, so that their rather peculiar erotic charms were only one of their characteristicsMan's consciousness was then far simpler, and his possession of it absurdly smallAn unlimited amount of what we now feel to be an integral part of our psychic being disports itself merrily for the primitive in projections ranging far and wide.
The word projection is not really appropriate, for nothing has been cast out of the psyche; rather, the psyche has attained its present complexity by a series of acts of introjectionIts complexity has increased in proportion to the despiritualization of natureAn alluring nixie from the dim bygone is today called an erotic fantasy, and she may complicate our psychic life in a most painful wayShe comes upon us just as a nixie might; she sits on top of us like a succubus; she changes into all sorts of shapes like a witch, and in general displays an unbearable independence that does not seem at all proper in a psychic contentOccasionally she causes states of fascination that rival the best bewitchment, or unleashes terrors in us not to be outdone by any manifestation of the devilShe is a mischievous being who crosses our path in numerous transformations and disguises, playing all kinds of tricks on us, causing happy and unhappy delusions, depressions and ecstasies, outbursts of affect, etcEven in a state of reasonable introjection the nixie has not laid aside her rogueryThe witch has not ceased to mix her vile potions of love and death; her magic poison has been refined into intrigue and self-deception, unseen though none the less dangerous for that.
But how do we dare to call this elfin being the anima? Anima means soul and should designate something very wonderful and immortalYet this was not always soWe should not forget that this kind of soul is a dogmatic conception whose purpose it is to pin down and capture something uncannily alive and activeThe German word Seele is closely related, via the Gothic form saiwalô, to the Greek word , which means quick-moving,' changeful of hue,' twinkling,' something like a butterfly—ψνχή in Greek—which reels drunkenly from flower to flower and lives on honey and loveIn Gnostic typology the ἂνθρωπος ψυχικός, psychic man,' is inferior to the πνευματικός, spiritual man,' and finally there are wicked souls who must roast in hell for all eternityEven the quite innocent soul of the unbaptized newborn babe is deprived of the contemplation of GodAmong primitives, the soul is the magic breath of life (hence the term anima), or a flameAn uncanonical saying of our Lord's aptly declares: Whoso is near unto me is near to the fire. For Heraclitus the soul at the highest level is fiery and dry, because ψνχή as such is closely akin to cool breath—ψύχαειν means to breathe,' to blow'; ψνχρός and ψῡχoς mean cold,' chill,' damp.'
Being that has soul is living beingSoul is the living thing in man, that which lives of itself and causes lifeTherefore God breathed into Adam a living breath, that he might liveWith her cunning play of illusions the soul lures into life the inertness of matter that does not want to liveShe makes us believe incredible things, that life may be livedShe is full of snares and traps, in order that man should fall, should reach the earth, entangle himself there, and stay caught, so that life should be lived; as Eve in the garden of Eden could not rest content until she had convinced Adam of the goodness of the forbidden appleWere it not for the leaping and twinkling of the soul, man would rot away in his greatest passion, idlenessA certain kind of reasonableness is its advocate, and a certain kind of morality adds its blessingBut to have soul is the whole venture of life, for soul is a life-giving daemon who plays his elfin game above and below human existence, for which reason—in the realm of dogma—he is threatened and propitiated with superhuman punishments and blessings that go far beyond the possible deserts of human beingsHeaven and hell are the fates meted out to the soul and not to civilized man, who in his nakedness and timidity would have no idea of what to do with himself in a heavenly Jerusalem.
The anima is not the soul in the dogmatic sense, not an anima rationalis, which is a philosophical conception, but a natural archetype that satisfactorily sums up all the statements of the unconscious, of the primitive mind, of the history of language and religionIt is a factor in the proper sense of the wordMan cannot make it; on the contrary, it is always the a priori element in his moods, reactions, impulses, and whatever else is spontaneous in psychic lifeIt is something that lives of itself, that makes us live; it is a life behind consciousness that cannot be completely integrated with it, but from which, on the contrary, consciousness arisesFor, in the last analysis, psychic life is for the greater part an unconscious life that surrounds consciousness on all sides—a notion that is sufficiently obvious when one considers how much unconscious preparation is needed, for instance, to register a sense-impression.
Although it seems as if the whole of our unconscious psychic life could be ascribed to the anima, she is yet only one archetype among manyTherefore, she is not characteristic of the unconscious in its entiretyShe is only one of its aspectsThis is shown by the very fact of her femininityWhat is not—I, not masculine, is most probably feminine, and because the not—I is felt as not belonging to me and therefore as outside me, the anima-image is usually projected upon womenEither sex is inhabited by the opposite sex up to a point, for, biologically speaking, it is simply the greater number of masculine genes that tips the scales in favour of masculinityThe smaller number of feminine genes seems to form a feminine character, which usually remains unconscious because of its subordinate position.
With the archetype of the anima we enter the realm of the gods, or rather, the realm that metaphysics has reserved for itselfEverything the anima touches becomes numinous—unconditional, dangerous, taboo, magicalShe is the serpent in the paradise of the harmless man with good resolutions and still better intentionsShe affords the most convincing reasons for not prying into the unconscious, an occupation that would break down our moral inhibitions and unleash forces that had better been left unconscious and undisturbedAs usual, there is something in what the anima says; for life in itself is not good only, it is also badBecause the anima wants life, she wants both good and badThese categories do not exist in the elfin realmBodily life as well as psychic life have the impudence to get along much better without conventional morality, and they often remain the healthier for it.
The anima believes in the καλόν κάγαθόν, the beautiful and the good,' a primitive conception that antedates the discovery of the conflict between aesthetics and moralsIt took more than a thousand years of Christian differentiation to make it clear that the good is not always the beautiful and the beautiful not necessarily goodThe paradox of this marriage of ideas troubled the ancients as little as it does the primitivesThe anima is conservative and clings in the most exasperating fashion to the ways of earlier humanityShe likes to appear in historic dress, with a predilection for Greece and EgyptIn this connection we would mention the classic anima stories of Rider Haggard and Pierre BenoîtThe Renaissance dream known as the Ipnerotomachia of Poliphilo, and Goethe's Faust, likewise reach deep into antiquity in order to find le vrai mot for the situationPoliphilo conjured up Queen Venus; Goethe, Helen of TroyAniela Jaffé has sketched a lively picture of the anima in the age of Biedermeier and the RomanticsIf you want to know what happens when the anima appears in modern society, I can warmly recommend John Erskine's Private Life of Helen of TroyShe is not a shallow creation, for the breath of eternity lies over everything that is really aliveThe anima lives beyond all categories, and can therefore dispense with blame as well as with praiseSince the beginning of time man, with his wholesome animal instinct, has been engaged in combat with his soul and its daemonismIf the soul were uniformly dark it would be a simple matterUnfortunately this is not so, for the anima can appear also as an angel of light, a psychopomp who points the way to the highest meaning, as we know from Faust.
If the encounter with the shadow is the apprentice-piece in the individual's development, then that with the anima is the master-piece. The relation with the anima is again a test of courage, an ordeal by fire for the spiritual and moral forces of manWe should never forget that in dealing with the anima we are dealing with psychic facts which have never been in man's possession before, since they were always found outside his psychic territory, so to speak, in the form of projectionsFor the son, the anima is hidden in the dominating power of the mother, and sometimes she leaves him with a sentimental attachment that lasts throughout life and seriously impairs the fate of the adultOn the other hand, she may spur him on to the highest flightsTo the men of antiquity the anima appeared as a goddess or a witch, while for medieval man the goddess was replaced by the Queen of Heaven and Mother ChurchThe desymbolized world of the Protestant produced first an unhealthy sentimentality and then a sharpening of the moral conflict, which, because it was so unbearable, led logically to Nietzsche's beyond good and evil. In centres of civilization this state shows itself in the increasing insecurity of marriageThe American divorce rate has been reached, if not exceeded, in many European countries, which proves that the anima projects herself by preference on the opposite sex, thus giving rise to magically complicated relationshipsThis fact, largely because of its pathological consequences, has led to the growth of modern psychology, which in its Freudian form cherishes the belief that the essential cause of all disturbances is sexuality—a view that only exacerbates the already existing conflictThere is a confusion here between cause and effectThe sexual disturbance is by no means the cause of neurotic difficulties, but is, like these, one of the pathological effects of a maladaptation of consciousness, as when consciousness is faced with situations and tasks to which it is not equalSuch a person simply does not understand how the world has altered, and what his attitude would have to be in order to adapt to it.
In dealing with the shadow or anima it is not sufficient just to know about these concepts and to reflect on themNor can we ever experience their content by feeling our way into them or by appropriating other people's feelingsIt is no use at all to learn a list of archetypes by heartArchetypes are complexes of experience that come upon us like fate, and their effects are felt in our most personal lifeThe anima no longer crosses our path as a goddess, but, it may be, as an intimately personal misadventure, or perhaps as our best ventureWhen, for instance, a highly esteemed professor in his seventies abandons his family and runs off with a young red-headed actress, we know that the gods have claimed another victimThis is how daemonic power reveals itself to usUntil not so long ago it would have been an easy matter to do away with the young woman as a witch.
In my experience there are very many people of intelligence and education who have no trouble in grasping the idea of the anima and her relative autonomy, and can also understand the phenomenology of the animus in womenPsychologists have more difficulties to overcome in this respect, probably because they are under no compulsion to grapple with the complex facts peculiar to the psychology of the unconsciousIf they are doctors as well, their somato-psychological thinking gets in the way, with its assumption that psychological processes can be expressed in intellectual, biological, or physiological termsPsychology, however, is neither biology nor physiology nor any other science than just this knowledge of the psyche.
The picture I have drawn of the anima so far is not completeAlthough she may be the chaotic urge to life, something strangely meaningful clings to her, a secret knowledge or hidden wisdom, which contrasts most curiously with her irrational elfin natureHere I would like to refer again to the authors already citedRider Haggard calls She Wisdom's Daughter; Benoît's Queen of Atlantis has an excellent library that even contains a lost book of PlatoHelen of Troy, in her reincarnation, is rescued from a Tyrian brothel by the wise Simon Magus and accompanies him on his travelsI purposely refrained from mentioning this thoroughly characteristic aspect of the anima earlier, because the first encounter with her usually leads one to infer anything rather than wisdomThis aspect appears only to the person who gets to grips with her seriouslyOnly then, when this hard task has been faced, does he come to realize more and more that behind all her cruel sporting with human fate there lies something like a hidden purpose which seems to reflect a superior knowledge of life's lawsIt is just the most unexpected, the most terrifyingly chaotic things which reveal a deeper meaningAnd the more this meaning is recognized, the more the anima loses her impetuous and compulsive characterGradually breakwaters are built against the surging of chaos, and the meaningful divides itself from the meaninglessWhen sense and nonsense are no longer identical, the force of chaos is weakened by their subtraction; sense is then endued with the force of meaning, and nonsense with the force of meaninglessnessIn this way a new cosmos arisesThis is not a new discovery in the realm of medical psychology, but the age-old truth that out of the richness of a man's experience there comes a teaching which the father can pass on to the son.
In elfin nature wisdom and folly appear as one and the same; and they are one and the same as long as they are acted out by the animaLife is crazy and meaningful at onceAnd when we do not laugh over the one aspect and speculate about the other, life is exceedingly drab, and everything is reduced to the littlest scaleThere is then little sense and little nonsense eitherWhen you come to think about it, nothing has any meaning, for when there was nobody to think, there was nobody to interpret what happenedInterpretations are only for those who don't understand; it is only the things we don't understand that have any meaningMan woke up in a world he did not understand, and that is why he tries to interpret it.
Thus the anima and life itself are meaningless in so far as they offer no interpretationYet they have a nature that can be interpreted, for in all chaos there is a cosmos, in all disorder a secret order, in all caprice a fixed law, for everything that works is grounded on its oppositeIt takes man's discriminating understanding, which breaks everything down, into antinomial judgments, to recognize thisOnce he comes to grips with the anima, her chaotic capriciousness will give him cause to suspect a secret order, to sense a plan, a meaning, a purpose over and above her nature, or even—we might almost be tempted to say—to postulate such a thing, though this would not be in accord with the truthFor in actual reality we do not have at our command any power of cool reflection, nor does any science or philosophy help us, and the traditional teachings of religion do so only to a limited degreeWe are caught and entangled in aimless experience, and the judging intellect with its categories proves itself powerlessHuman interpretation fails, for a turbulent life-situation has arisen that refuses to fit any of the traditional meanings assigned to itIt is a moment of collapseWe sink into a final depth—Apuleius calls it a kind of voluntary death. It is a surrender of our own powers, not artificially willed but forced upon us by nature; not a voluntary submission and humiliation decked in moral garb but an utter and unmistakable defeat crowned with the panic fear of demoralizationOnly when all props and crutches are broken, and no cover from the rear offers even the slightest hope of security, does it become possible for us to experience an archetype that up till then had lain hidden behind the meaningful nonsense played out by the animaThis is the archetype of meaning, just as the anima is the archetype of life itself.
It always seems to us as if meaning—compared with life—were the younger event, because we assume, with some justification, that we assign it of ourselves, and because we believe, equally rightly no doubt, that the great world can get along without being interpretedBut how do we assign meaning? From what source, in the last analysis, do we derive meaning? The forms we use for assigning meaning are historical categories that reach back into the mists of time—a fact we do not take sufficiently into accountInterpretations make use of certain linguistic matrices that are themselves derived from primordial imagesFrom whatever side we approach this question, everywhere we find ourselves confronted with the history of language, with images and motifs that lead straight back to the primitive wonder-world.
Take, for instance, the word idea. It goes back to the είδoς concept of Plato, and the eternal ideas are primordial images stored up ἐv ὑπερονρανίῳ το'πῳ (in a supracelestial place) as eternal, transcendent formsThe eye of the seer perceives them as imagines et lares, or as images in dreams and revelatory visionsOr let us take the concept of energy, which is an interpretation of physical eventsIn earlier times it was the secret fire of the alchemists, or phlogiston, or the heat-force inherent in matter, like the primal warmth of the Stoics, or the Heraclitean πῡρ ἀεί ζωον (ever-living fire), which borders on the primitive notion of an all-pervading vital force, a power of growth and magic healing that is generally called mana.
I will not go on needlessly giving examplesIt is sufficient to know that there is not a single important idea or view that does not possess historical antecedentsUltimately they are all founded on primordial archetypal forms whose concreteness dates from a time when consciousness did not think, but only perceivedThoughts were objects of inner perception, not thought at all, but sensed as external phenomena—seen or heard, so to speakThought was essentially revelation, not invented but forced upon us or bringing conviction through its immediacy and actualityThinking of this kind precedes the primitive ego-consciousness, and the latter is more its object than its subjectBut we ourselves have not yet climbed the last peak of consciousness, so we also have a pre-existent thinking, of which we are not aware so long as we are supported by traditional symbols—or, to put it in the language of dreams, so long as the father or the king is not dead.
I would like to give you an example of how the unconscious thinks and paves the way for solutionsIt is the case of a young theological student, whom I did not know personallyHe was in great straits because of his religious beliefs, and about this time he dreamed the following dream:
He was standing in the presence of a handsome old man dressed entirely in blackHe knew it was the white magicianThis personage had just addressed him at considerable length, but the dreamer could no longer remember what it was aboutHe had only retained the closing words: And for this we need the help of the black magician. At that moment the door opened and in came another old man exactly like the first, except that he was dressed in whiteHe said to the white magician, I need your advice, but threw a sidelong, questioning look at the dreamer, whereupon the white magician answered: You can speak freely, he is an innocent. The black magician then began to relate his storyHe had come from a distant land where something extraordinary had happenedThe country was ruled by an old king who felt his death nearHe—the king—had sought out a tomb for himselfFor there were in that land a great number of tombs from ancient times, and the king had chosen the finest for himselfAccording to legend, a virgin had been buried in itThe king caused the tomb to be opened, in order to get it ready for useBut when the bones it contained were exposed to the light of day, they suddenly took on life and changed into a black horse, which at once fled into the desert and there vanishedThe black magician had heard of this story and immediately set forth in pursuit of the horseAfter a journey of many days, always on the tracks of the horse, he came to the desert and crossed to the other side, where the grasslands began againThere he met the horse grazing, and there also he came upon the find on whose account he now needed the advice of the white magicianFor he had found the lost keys of paradise, and he did not know what to do with themAt this exciting moment the dreamer awoke.
In the light of our earlier remarks the meaning of the dream is not hard to guess: the old king is the ruling symbol that wants to go to its eternal rest, and in the very place where similar dominants lie buriedHis choice falls, fittingly enough, on the grave of anima, who lies in the death trance of a Sleeping Beauty so long as the king is alive—that is, so long as a valid principle (Prince or princeps) regulates and expresses lifeBut when the king draws to his end, she comes to life again and changes into a black horse, which in Plato's parable stands for the unruliness of the passionsAnyone who follows this horse comes into the desert, into a wild land remote from men—an image of spiritual and moral isolationBut there lie the keys of paradise.
Now what is paradise? Clearly, the Garden of Eden with its two-faced tree of life and knowledge and its four streamsIn the Christian version it is also the heavenly city of the Apocalypse, which, like the Garden of Eden, is conceived as a mandalaBut the mandala is a symbol of individuationSo it is the black magician who finds the keys to the solution of the problems of belief weighing on the dreamer, the keys that open the way of individuationThe contrast between desert and paradise therefore signifies isolation as contrasted with individuation, or the becoming of the self.
This part of the dream is a remarkable paraphrase of the Oxyrhynchus sayings of Jesus, in which the way to the kingdom of heaven is pointed out by animals, and where we find the admonition: Therefore know yourselves, for you are the city, and the city is the kingdom. It is also a paraphrase of the serpent of paradise who persuaded our first parents to sin, and who finally leads to the redemption of mankind through the Son of GodAs we know, this causal nexus gave rise to the Ophitic identification of the serpent with the Σωτήρ (Saviour)The black horse and the black magician are half-evil elements whose relativity with respect to good is hinted at in the exchange of garmentsThe two magicians are, indeed, two aspects of the wise old man, the superior master and teacher, the archetype of the spirit, who symbolizes the pre-existent meaning hidden in the chaos of lifeHe is the father of the soul, and yet the soul, in some miraculous manner, is also his virgin mother, for which reason he was called by the alchemists the first son of the mother. The black magician and the black horse correspond to the descent into darkness in the dreams mentioned earlier.
What an unbearably hard lesson for a young student of theology! Fortunately he was not in the least aware that the father of all prophets had spoken to him in the dream and placed a great secret almost within his graspOne marvels at the inappropriateness of such occurrencesWhy this prodigality? But I have to admit that we do not know how this dream affected the student in the long run, and I must emphasize that to me, at least, the dream had a very great deal to sayIt was not allowed to get lost, even though the dreamer did not understand it.
The old man in this dream is obviously trying to show how good and evil function together, presumably as an answer to the still unresolved moral conflict in the Christian psycheWith this peculiar relativization of opposites we find ourselves approaching nearer to the ideas of the East, to the nirdvandva of Hindu philosophy, the freedom from opposites, which is shown as a possible way of solving the conflict through reconciliationHow perilously fraught with meaning this Eastern relativity of good and evil is, can be seen from the Indian aphoristic question: Who takes longer to reach perfection, the man who loves God, or the man who hates him? And the answer is: He who loves God takes seven reincarnations to reach perfection, and he who hates God takes only three, for he who hates God will think of him more than he who loves him, Freedom from opposites presupposes their functional equivalence, and this offends our Christian feelingsNonetheless, as our dream example shows, the balanced co-operation of moral opposites is a natural truth which has been recognized just as naturally by the EastThe clearest example of this is to be found in Taoist philosophyBut in the Christian tradition, too, there are various sayings that come very close to this standpointI need only remind you of the parable of the unjust steward.
Our dream is by no means unique in this respect, for the tendency to relativize opposites is a notable peculiarity of the unconscious One must immediately add, however, that this is true only in cases of exaggerated moral sensibility; in other cases the unconscious can insist just as inexorably on the irreconcilability of the oppositesAs a rule, the standpoint of the unconscious is relative to the conscious attitudeWe can probably say, therefore, that our dream presupposes the specific beliefs and doubts of a theological consciousness of Protestant persuasionThis limits the statement of the dream to a definite set of problemsBut even with this paring down of its validity the dream clearly demonstrates the superiority of its standpointFittingly enough, it expresses its meaning in the opinion and voice of a wise magician, who goes back in direct line to the figure of the medicine man in primitive societyHe is, like the anima, an immortal daemon that pierces the chaotic darknesses of brute life with the light of meaningHe is the enlightener, the master and teacher, a psychopomp whose personification even Nietzsche, that breaker of tablets, could not escape—for he had called up his reincarnation in Zarathustra, the lofty spirit of an almost Homeric age, as the carrier and mouthpiece of his own Dionysian enlightenment and ecstasyFor him God was dead, but the driving daemon of wisdom became as it were his bodily doubleHe himself says:
Zarathustra is more for Nietzsche than a poetic figure; he is an involuntary confession, a testamentNietzsche too had lost his way in the darknesses of a life that turned its back upon God and Christianity, and that is why there came to him the revealer and enlightener, the speaking fountainhead of his soulHere is the source of the hieratic language of Zarathustra, for that is the style of this archetype.
Modern man, in experiencing this archetype, comes to know that most ancient form of thinking as an autonomous activity whose object he isHermes Trismegistus or the Thoth of Hermetic literature, Orpheus, the Poimandres (shepherd of men) and his near relation the Poimen of Hermes, are other formulations of the same experienceIf the name Lucifer were not prejudicial, it would be a very suitable one for this archetypeBut I have been content to call it the archetype of the wise old man, or of meaningLike all archetypes it has a positive and a negative aspect, though I don't want to enter into this hereThe reader will find a detailed exposition of the two-facedness of the wise old man in The Phenomenology of the Spirit in Fairytales.
The three archetypes so far discussed—the shadow, the anima, and the wise old man—are of a kind that can be directly experienced in personified formIn the foregoing I tried to indicate the general psychological conditions in which such an experience arisesBut what I conveyed were only abstract generalizationsOne could, or rather should, really give a description of the process as it occurs in immediate experienceIn the course of this process the archetypes appear as active personalities in dreams and fantasiesBut the process itself involves another class of archetypes which one could call the archetypes of transformationThey are not personalities, but are typical situations, places, ways and means, that symbolize the kind of transformation in questionLike the personalities, these archetypes are true and genuine symbols that cannot be exhaustively interpreted, either as signs or as allegoriesThey are genuine symbols precisely because they are ambiguous, full of half-glimpsed meanings, and in the last resort inexhaustibleThe ground principles, the ἀρxί, of the unconscious are indescribable because of their wealth of reference, although in themselves recognizableThe discriminating intellect naturally keeps on trying to establish their singleness of meaning and thus misses the essential point; for what we can above all establish as the one thing consistent with their nature is their manifold meaning, their almost limitless wealth of reference, which makes any unilateral formulation impossibleBesides this, they are in principle paradoxical, just as for the alchemists the spirit was conceived as senex et iuvenis simul—an old man and a youth at once.
If one wants to form a picture of the symbolic process, the series of pictures found in alchemy are good examples, though the symbols they contain are for the most part traditional despite their often obscure origin and significanceAn excellent Eastern example is the Tantric chakra system, or the mystical nerve system of Chinese yogaIt also seems as if the set of pictures in the Tarot cards were distantly descended from the archetypes of transformation, a view that has been confirmed for me in a very enlightening lecture by Professor Bernoulli.
The symbolic process is an experience in images and of imagesIts development usually shows an enantiodromian structure like the text of the I Ching, and so presents a rhythm of negative and positive, loss and gain, dark and lightIts beginning is almost invariably characterized by one's getting stuck in a blind alley or in some impossible situation; and its goal is, broadly speaking, illumination or higher consciousness, by means of which the initial situation is overcome on a higher levelAs regards the time factor, the process may be compressed into a single dream or into a short moment of experience, or it may extend over months and years, depending on the nature of the initial situation, the person involved in the process, and the goal to be reachedThe wealth of symbols naturally varies enormously from case to caseAlthough everything is experienced in image form, i.e., symbolically, it is by no means a question of fictitious dangers but of very real risks upon which the fate of a whole life may dependThe chief danger is that of succumbing to the fascinating influence of the archetypes, and this is most likely to happen when the archetypal images are not made consciousIf there is already a predisposition to psychosis, it may even happen that the archetypal figures, which are endowed with a certain autonomy anyway on account of their natural numinosity, will escape from conscious control altogether and become completely independent, thus producing the phenomena of possessionIn the case of an anima-possession, for instance, the patient will want to change himself into a woman through self-castration, or he is afraid that something of the sort will be done to him by forceThe best-known example of this is Schreber's Memoirs of My Nervous IllnessPatients often discover a whole anima mythology with numerous archaic motifsA case of this kind was published some time ago by NelkenAnother patient has described his experiences himself and commented on them in a bookI mention these examples because there are still people who think that the archetypes are subjective chimeras of my own brain.
The things that come to light brutally in insanity remain hidden in the background in neurosis, but they continue to influence consciousness nonethelessWhen, therefore, the analysis penetrates the background of conscious phenomena, it discovers the same archetypal figures that activate the deliriums of psychoticsFinally, there is any amount of literary and historical evidence to prove that in the case of these archetypes we are dealing with normal types of fantasy that occur practically everywhere and not with the monstrous products of insanityThe pathological element does not lie in the existence of these ideas, but in the dissociation of consciousness that can no longer control the unconsciousIn all cases of dissociation it is therefore necessary to integrate the unconscious into consciousnessThis is a synthetic process which I have termed the individuation process.
As a matter of fact, this process follows the natural course of life—a life in which the individual becomes what he always wasBecause man has consciousness, a development of this kind does not run very smoothly; often it is varied and disturbed, because consciousness deviates again and again from its archetypal, instinctual foundation and finds itself in opposition to itThere then arises the need for a synthesis of the two positionsThis amounts to psychotherapy even on the primitive level, where it takes the form of restitution ceremoniesAs examples I would mention the identification of the Australian aborigines with their ancestors in the alcheringa period, identification with the sons of the sun among the Pueblos of Taos, the Helios apotheosis in the Isis mysteries, and so onAccordingly, the therapeutic method of complex psychology consists on the one hand in making as fully conscious as possible the constellated unconscious contents, and on the other hand in synthetizing them with consciousness through the act of recognitionSince, however, civilized man possesses a high degree of dissociability and makes continual use of it in order to avoid every possible risk, it is by no means a foregone conclusion that recognition will be followed by the appropriate actionOn the contrary, we have to reckon with the singular ineffectiveness of recognition and must therefore insist on a meaningful application of itRecognition by itself does not as a rule do this, nor does it imply, as such, any moral strengthIn these cases it becomes very clear how much the cure of neurosis is a moral problem.
As the archetypes, like all numinous contents, are relatively autonomous, they cannot be integrated simply by rational means, but require a dialectical procedure, a real coming to terms with them, often conducted by the patient in dialogue form, so that, without knowing it, he puts into effect the alchemical definition of the meditatio: an inner colloquy with one's good angel. Usually the process runs a dramatic course, with many ups and downsIt expresses itself in, or is accompanied by, dream symbols that are related to the représentations collectives, which in the form of mythological motifs have portrayed psychic processes of transformation since the earliest times.
In the short space of a lecture I must content myself with giving only a few examples of archetypesI have chosen the ones that play the chief part in an analysis of the masculine psyche, and have tried to give you some idea of the transformation process in which they appearSince this lecture was first published, the figures of the shadow, anima, and wise old man, together with the corresponding figures of the feminine unconscious, have been dealt with in greater detail in my contributions to the symbolism of the self, and the individuation process in its relation to alchemical symbolism has also been subjected to closer investigation.
The collective unconscious is a part of the psyche which can be negatively distinguished from a personal unconscious by the fact that it does not, like the latter, owe its existence to personal experience and consequently is not a personal acquisitionWhile the personal unconscious is made up essentially of contents which have at one time been conscious but which have disappeared from consciousness through having been forgotten or repressed, the contents of the collective unconscious have never been in consciousness, and therefore have never been individually acquired, but owe their existence exclusively to heredityWhereas the personal unconscious consists for the most part of complexes, the content of the collective unconscious is made up essentially of archetypes.
The concept of the archetype, which is an indispensable correlate of the idea of the collective unconscious, indicates the existence of definite forms in the psyche which seem to be present always and everywhereMythological research calls them motifs; in the psychology of primitives they correspond to Lévy-Bruhl's concept of représentations collectives, and in the field of comparative religion they have been defined by Hubert and Mauss as categories of the imagination. Adolf Bastian long ago called them elementary or primordial thoughts. From these references it should be clear enough that my idea of the archetype—literally a pre-existent form—does not stand alone but is something that is recognized and named in other fields of knowledge.
My thesis, then, is as follows: In addition to our immediate consciousness, which is of a thoroughly personal nature and which we believe to be the only empirical psyche (even if we tack on the personal unconscious as an appendix), there exists a second psychic system of a collective, universal, and impersonal nature which is identical in all individualsThis collective unconscious does not develop individually but is inheritedIt consists of pre-existent forms, the archetypes, which can only become conscious secondarily and which give definite form to certain psychic contents.
Medical psychology, growing as it did out of professional practice, insists on the personal nature of the psycheBy this I mean the views of Freud and AdlerIt is a psychology of the person, and its aetiological or causal factors are regarded almost wholly as personal in natureNonetheless, even this psychology is based on certain general biological factors, for instance on the sexual instinct or on the urge for self-assertion, which are by no means merely personal peculiaritiesIt is forced to do this because it lays claim to being an explanatory scienceNeither of these views would deny the existence of a priori instincts common to man and animals alike, or that they have a significant influence on personal psychologyYet instincts are impersonal, universally distributed, hereditary factors of a dynamic or motivating character, which very often fail so completely to reach consciousness that modern psychotherapy is faced with the task of helping the patient to become conscious of themMoreover, the instincts are not vague and indefinite by nature, but are specifically formed motive forces which, long before there is any consciousness, and in spite of any degree of consciousness later on, pursue their inherent goalsConsequently they form very close analogies to the archetypes, so close, in fact, that there is good reason for supposing that the archetypes are the unconscious images of the instincts themselves, in other words, that they are patterns of instinctual behaviour.
The hypothesis of the collective unconscious is, therefore, no more daring than to assume there are instinctsOne admits readily that human activity is influenced to a high degree by instincts, quite apart from the rational motivations of the conscious mindSo if the assertion is made that our imagination, perception, and thinking are likewise influenced by inborn and universally present formal elements, it seems to me that a normally functioning intelligence can discover in this idea just as much or just as little mysticism as in the theory of instinctsAlthough this reproach of mysticism has frequently been levelled at my concept, I must emphasize yet again that the concept of the collective unconscious is neither a speculative nor a philosophical but an empirical matterThe question is simply this: are there or are there not unconscious, universal forms of this kind? If they exist, then there is a region of the psyche which one can call the collective unconsciousIt is true that the diagnosis of the collective unconscious is not always an easy taskIt is not sufficient to point out the often obviously archetypal nature of unconscious products, for these can just as well be derived from acquisitions through language and educationCryptomnesia should also be ruled out, which it is almost impossible to do in certain casesIn spite of all these difficulties, there remain enough individual instances showing the autochthonous revival of mythological motifs to put the matter beyond any reasonable doubtBut if such an unconscious exists at all, psychological explanation must take account of it and submit certain alleged personal aetiologies to sharper criticism.
What I mean can perhaps best be made clear by a concrete exampleYou have probably read Freud's discussion of a certain picture by Leonardo da Vinci: StAnne with the Virgin Mary and the Christ-childFreud interprets this remarkable picture in terms of the fact that Leonardo himself had two mothersThis causality is personalWe shall not linger over the fact that this picture is far from unique, nor over the minor inaccuracy that StAnne happens to be the grandmother of Christ and not, as required by Freud's interpretation, the mother, but shall simply point out that interwoven with the apparently personal psychology there is an impersonal motif well known to us from other fieldsThis is the motif of the dual mother, an archetype to be found in many variants in the field of mythology and comparative religion and forming the basis of numerous représentations collectives. I might mention, for instance, the motif of the dual descent, that is, descent from human and divine parents, as in the case of Heracles, who received immortality through being unwittingly adopted by HeraWhat was a myth in Greece was actually a ritual in Egypt: Pharaoh was both human and divine by natureIn the birth chambers of the Egyptian temples Pharaoh's second, divine conception and birth is depicted on the walls; he is twice-born. It is an idea that underlies all rebirth mysteries, Christianity includedChrist himself is twiceborn: through his baptism in the Jordan he was regenerated and reborn from water and spiritConsequently, in the Roman liturgy the font is designated the uterus ecclesiae, and, as you can read in the Roman missal, it is called this even today, in the benediction of the font on Holy Saturday before EasterFurther, according to an early Christan-Gnostic idea, the spirit which appeared in the form of a dove was interpreted as Sophia-Sapientia—Wisdom and the Mother of ChristThanks to this motif of the dual birth, children today, instead of having good and evil fairies who magically adopt them at birth with blessings or curses, are given sponsors—a godfather and a godmother.
The idea of a second birth is found at all times and in all placesIn the earliest beginnings of medicine it was a magical means of healing; in many religions it is the central mystical experience; it is the key idea in medieval, occult philosophy, and, last but not least, it is an infantile fantasy occurring in numberless children, large and small, who believe that their parents are not their real parents but merely foster-parents to whom they were handed overBenvenuto Cellini also had this idea, as he himself relates in his autobiography.
Now it is absolutely out of the question that all the individuals who believe in a dual descent have in reality always had two mothers, or conversely that those few who shared Leonardo's fate have infected the rest of humanity with their complexRather, one cannot avoid the assumption that the universal occurrence of the dual-birth motif together with the fantasy of the two mothers answers an omnipresent human need which is reflected in these motifsIf Leonardo da Vinci did in fact portray his two mothers in StAnne and Mary—which I doubt—he nonetheless was only expressing something which countless millions of people before and after him have believedThe vulture symbol (which Freud also discusses in the work mentioned) makes this view all the more plausibleWith some justification he quotes as the source of the symbol the Hieroglyphica of Horapollo, a book much in use in Leonardo's timeThere you read that vultures are female only and symbolize the motherThey conceive through the wind (pneuma)This word took on the meaning of spirit chiefly under the influence of ChristianityEven in the account of the miracle at Pentecost the pneuma still has the double meaning of wind and spiritThis fact, in my opinion, points without doubt to Mary, who, a virgin by nature, conceived through the pneuma, like a vultureFurthermore, according to Horapollo, the vulture also symbolizes Athene, who sprang, unbegotten, directly from the head of Zeus, was a virgin, and knew only spiritual motherhoodAll this is really an allusion to Mary and the rebirth motifThere is not a shadow of evidence that Leonardo meant anything else by his pictureEven if it is correct to assume that he identified himself with the Christ-child, he was in all probability representing the mythological dual-mother motif and by no means his own personal prehistoryAnd what about all the other artists who painted the same theme? Surely not all of them had two mothers?
Let us now transpose Leonardo's case to the field of the neuroses, and assume that a patient with a mother complex is suffering from the delusion that the cause of his neurosis lies in his having really had two mothersThe personal interpretation would have to admit that he is right—and yet it would be quite wrongFor in reality the cause of his neurosis would lie in the reactivation of the dual-mother archetype, quite regardless of whether he had one mother or two mothers, because, as we have seen, this archetype functions individually and historically without any reference to the relatively rare occurrence of dual motherhood.
In such a case, it is of course tempting to presuppose so simple and personal a cause, yet the hypothesis is not only inexact but totally falseIt is admittedly difficult to understand how a dual-mother motif—unknown to a physician trained only in medicine—could have so great a determining power as to produce the effect of a traumatic conditionBut if we consider the tremendous powers that lie hidden in the mythological and religious sphere in man, the aetiological significance of the archetype appears less fantasticIn numerous cases of neurosis the cause of the disturbance lies in the very fact that the psychic life of the patient lacks the co-operation of these motive forcesNevertheless a purely personalistic psychology, by reducing everything to personal causes, tries its level best to deny the existence of archetypal motifs and even seeks to destroy them by personal analysisI consider this a rather dangerous procedure which cannot be justified medicallyToday you can judge better than you could twenty years ago the nature of the forces involvedCan we not see how a whole nation is reviving an archaic symbol, yes, even archaic religious forms, and how this mass emotion is influencing and revolutionizing the life of the individual in a catastrophic manner? The man of the past is alive in us today to a degree undreamt of before the war, and in the last analysis what is the fate of great nations but a summation of the psychic changes in individuals?
So far as a neurosis is really only a private affair, having its roots exclusively in personal causes, archetypes play no role at allBut if it is a question of a general incompatibility or an otherwise injurious condition productive of neuroses in relatively large numbers of individuals, then we must assume the presence of constellated archetypesSince neuroses are in most cases not just private concerns, but social phenomena, we must assume that archetypes are constellated in these cases tooThe archetype corresponding to the situation is activated, and as a result those explosive and dangerous forces hidden in the archetype come into action, frequently with unpredictable consequencesThere is no lunacy people under the domination of an archetype will not fall a prey toIf thirty years ago anyone had dared to predict that our psychological development was tending towards a revival of the medieval persecutions of the Jews, that Europe would again tremble before the Roman fasces and the tramp of legions, that people would once more give the Roman salute, as two thousand years ago, and that instead of the Christian Cross an archaic swastika would lure onward millions of warriors ready for death—why, that man would have been hooted at as a mystical foolAnd today? Surprising as it may seem, all this absurdity is a horrible realityPrivate life, private aetiologies, and private neuroses have become almost a fiction in the world of todayThe man of the past who lived in a world of archaic représentations collectives has risen again into very visible and painfully real life, and this not only in a few unbalanced individuals but in many millions of people.
There are as many archetypes as there are typical situations in lifeEndless repetition has engraved these experiences into our psychic constitution, not in the form of images filled with content, but at first only as forms without content, representing merely the possibility of a certain type of perception and actionWhen a situation occurs which corresponds to a given archetype, that archetype becomes activated and a compulsiveness appears, which, like an instinctual drive, gains its way against all reason and will, or else produces a conflict of pathological dimensions, that is to say, a neurosis.
We must now turn to the question of how the existence of archetypes can be produceSince archetypes are supposed to produce certain psychic forms, we must discuss how and where one can get hold of the material demonstrating these formsThe main source, then, is dreams, which have the advantage of being involuntary, spontaneous products of the unconscious psyche and are therefore pure products of nature not falsified by any conscious purposeBy questioning the individual one can ascertain which of the motifs appearing in the dream are known to himFrom those which are unknown to him we must naturally exclude all motifs which might be known to him, as for instance—to revert to the case of Leonardo—the vulture symbolWe are not sure whether Leonardo took this symbol from Horapollo or not, although it would have been perfectly possible for an educated person of that time, because in those days artists were distinguished for their wide knowledge of the humanitiesTherefore, although the bird motif is an archetype par excellence, its existence in Leonardo's fantasy would still prove nothingConsequently, we must look for motifs which could not possibly be known to the dreamer and yet behave functionally in his dream in such a manner as to coincide with the functioning of the archetype known from historical sources.
Another source for the material we need is to be found in active imagination. By this I mean a sequence of fantasies produced by deliberate concentrationI have found that the existence of unrealized, unconscious fantasies increases the frequency and intensity of dreams, and that when these fantasies are made conscious the dreams change their character and become weaker and less frequentFrom this I have drawn the conclusion that dreams often contain fantasies which want to become consciousThe sources of dreams are often repressed instincts which have a natural tendency to influence the conscious mindIn cases of this sort, the patient is simply given the task of contemplating any one fragment of fantasy that seems significant to him—a chance idea, perhaps, or something he has become conscious of in a dream—until its context becomes visible, that is to say, the relevant associative material in which it is embeddedIt is not a question of the free association recommended by Freud for the purpose of dream-analysis, but of elaborating the fantasy by observing the further fantasy material that adds itself to the fragment in a natural manner.
This is not the place to enter upon a technical discussion of the methodSuffice it to say that the resultant sequence of fantasies relieves the unconscious and produces material rich in archetypal images and associationsObviously, this is a method that can only be used in certain carefully selected casesThe method is not entirely without danger, because it may carry the patient too far away from realityA warning against thoughtless application is therefore in place.
Finally, very interesting sources of archetypal material are to be found in the delusions of paranoiacs, the fantasies observed in trance-states, and the dreams of early childhood, from the third to the fifth yearSuch material is available in profusion, but it is valueless unless one can adduce convincing mythological parallelsIt does not, of course, suffice simply to connect a dream about a snake with the mythological occurrence of snakes, for who is to guarantee that the functional meaning of the snake in the dream is the same as in the mythological setting? In order to draw a valid parallel, it is necessary to know the functional meaning of the individual symbol, and then to find out whether the apparently parallel mythological symbol has a similar context and therefore the same functional meaningEstablishing such facts not only requires lengthy and wearisome researches, but is also an ungrateful subject for demonstrationAs the symbols must not be torn out of their context, one has to launch forth into exhaustive descriptions, personal as well as symbological, and this is practically impossible in the framework of a lectureI have repeatedly tried it at the risk of sending one half of my audience to sleep.
I am choosing as an example a case which, though already published, I use again because its brevity makes it peculiarly suitable for illustrationMoreover, I can add certain remarks which were omitted in the previous publication.
About  I came across a very curious delusion in a paranoid schizophrenic who had been interned for many yearsThe patient had suffered since his youth and was incurableHe had been educated at a State school and been employed as a clerk in an officeHe had no special gifts, and I myself knew nothing of mythology or archaeology in those days, so the situation was not in any way suspectOne day I found the patient standing at the window, wagging his head and blinking into the sunHe told me to do the same, for then I would see something very interestingWhen I asked him what he saw, he was astonished that I could see nothing, and said: Surely you see the sun's penis—when I move my head to and fro, it moves too, and that is where the wind comes from. Naturally I did not understand this strange idea in the least, but I made a note of itThen about four years later, during my mythological studies, I came upon a book by the late Albrecht Dieterich, the well-known philologist, which threw light on this fantasyThe work, published in , deals with a Greek papyrus in the Bibliothèque Nationale, ParisDieterich believed he had discovered a Mithraic ritual in one part of the textThe text is undoubtedly a religious prescription for carrying out certain incantations in which Mithras is namedIt comes from the Alexandrian school of mysticism and shows affinities with certain passages in the Leiden papyri and the Corpus HermeticumIn Dieterich's text we read the following directions:
Draw breath from the rays, draw in three times as strongly as you can and you will feel yourself raised up and walking towards the height, and you will seem to be in the middle of the aerial region.… The path of the visible gods will appear through the disc of the sun, who is God my fatherLikewise the so-called tube, the origin of the ministering windFor you will see hanging down from the disc of the sun something that looks like a tubeAnd towards the regions westward it is as though there were an infinite east windBut if the other wind should prevail towards the regions of the east, you will in like manner see the vision veering in that direction.
It is obviously the author's intention to enable the reader to experience the vision which he had, or which at least he believes inThe reader is to be initiated into the inner religious experience either of the author, or—what seems more likely—of one of those mystic communities of which Philo Judaeus gives contemporary accountsThe fire- or sun-god here invoked is a figure which has close historical parallels, for instance with the Christ-figure of the ApocalypseIt is therefore a représentation collective, as are also the ritual actions described, such as the imitating of animal noises, etcThe vision is embedded in a religious context of a distinctly ecstatic nature and describes a kind of initiation into mystic experience of the Deity.
Our patient was about ten years older than IIn his megalomania, he thought he was God and Christ in one personHis attitude towards me was patronizing; he liked me probably because I was the only person with any sympathy for his abstruse ideasHis delusions were mainly religious, and when he invited me to blink into the sun like he did and waggle my head he obviously wanted to let me share his visionHe played the role of the mystic sage and I was the neophyteHe felt he was the sun-god himself, creating the wind by wagging his head to and froThe ritual transformation into the Deity is attested by Apuleius in the Isis mysteries, and moreover in the form of a Helios apotheosisThe meaning of the ministering wind is probably the same as the procreative pneuma, which streams from the sun-god into the soul and fructifies itThe association of sun and wind frequently occurs in ancient symbolism.
It must now be shown that this is not a purely chance coincidence of two isolated casesWe must therefore show that the idea of a wind-tube connected with God or the sun exists independently of these two testimonies and that it occurs at other times and in other placesNow there are, as a matter of fact, medieval paintings that depict the fructification of Mary with a tube or hose-pipe coming down from the throne of God and passing into her body, and we can see the dove or the Christ-child flying down itThe dove represents the fructifying agent, the wind of the Holy Ghost.
Now it is quite out of the question that the patient could have had any knowledge whatever of a Greek papyrus published four years later, and it is in the highest degree unlikely that his vision had anything to do with the rare medieval representations of the Conception, even if through some incredibly improbable chance he had ever seen a copy of such a paintingThe patient was certified in his early twentiesHe had never travelledAnd there is no such picture in the public art gallery in Zurich, his native town.
I mention this case not in order to prove that the vision is an archetype but only to show you my method of procedure in the simplest possible formIf we had only such cases, the task of investigation would be relatively easy, but in reality the proof is much more complicatedFirst of all, certain symbols have to be isolated clearly enough to be recognizable as typical phenomena, not just matters of chanceThis is done by examining a series of dreams, say a few hundred, for typical figures, and by observing their development in the seriesThe same method can be applied to the products of active imaginationIn this way it is possible to establish certain continuities or modulations of one and the same figureYou can select any figure which gives the impression of being an archetype by its behaviour in the series of dreams or visionsIf the material at one's disposal has been well observed and is sufficiently ample, one can discover interesting facts about the variations undergone by a single typeNot only the type itself but its variants too can be substantiated by evidence from comparative mythology and ethnologyI have described the method of investigation elsewhere and have also furnished the necessary case material.
Although modern man appears to believe that the non-empirical approach to psychology is a thing of the past, his general attitude remains very much the same as it was before, when psychology was identified with some theory about the psycheIn academic circles, a drastic revolution in methodology, initiated by Fechner and Wundt, was needed in order to make clear to the scientific world that psychology was a field of experience and not a philosophical theoryTo the increasing materialism of the late nineteenth century, however, it meant nothing that there had once been an experimental psychology, to which we owe many descriptions that are still valuable todayI have only to mention DrJustinus Kernel's Seherin von PrevorstAll romantic descriptions in psychology were anathema to the new developments in scientific methodThe exaggerated expectations of this experimental laboratory science were reflected in Fechner's psychophysics, and its results today take the form of psychological tests and a general shifting of the scientific standpoint in favour of phenomenology.
Nevertheless, it cannot be maintained that the phenomenological point of view has made much headwayTheory still plays far too great a role, instead of being included in phenomenology as it shouldEven Freud, whose empirical attitude is beyond doubt, coupled his theory as a sine qua non with his method, as if psychic phenomena had to be viewed in a certain light in order to mean somethingAll the same, it was Freud who cleared the ground for the investigation of complex phenomena, at least in the field of neurosisBut the ground he cleared extended only so far as certain basic physiological concepts permitted, so that it looked almost as if psychology were an offshoot of the physiology of the instinctsThis limitation of psychology was very welcome to the materialistic outlook of that time, nearly fifty years ago, and, despite our altered view of the world, it still is in large measure todayIt gives us not only the advantage of a delimited field of work, but also an excellent excuse not to bother with what goes on in a wider world.
Thus it was overlooked by the whole of medical psychology that a psychology of the neuroses, such as Freud's, is left hanging in mid air if it lacks knowledge of a general phenomenologyIt was also overlooked that in the field of the neuroses Pierre Janet, even before Freud, had begun to build up a descriptive methodology without loading it with too many theoretical and philosophical assumptionsBiographical descriptions of psychic phenomena, going beyond the strictly medical field, were represented chiefly by the work of the philosopher Théodore Flournoy, of Geneva, in his account of the psychology of an unusual personalityThis was followed by the first attempt at synthesis: William James's Varieties of Religious Experience ()I owe it mainly to these two investigators that I learnt to understand the nature of psychic disturbances within the setting of the human psyche as a wholeI myself did experimental work for several years, but, through my intensive studies of the neuroses and psychoses, I had to admit that, however desirable quantitative definitions may be, it is impossible to do without qualitatively descriptive methodsMedical psychology has recognized that the salient facts are extraordinarily complex and can be grasped only through descriptions based on case materialBut this method presupposes freedom from theoretical prejudiceEvery science is descriptive at the point where it can no longer proceed experimentally, without on that account ceasing to be scientificBut an experimental science makes itself impossible when it delimits its field of work in accordance with theoretical conceptsThe psyche does not come to an end where some physiological assumption or other stopsIn other words, in each individual case that we observe scientifically, we have to consider the manifestations of the psyche in their totality.
These reflections are essential when discussing an empirical concept like that of the animaAs against the constantly reiterated prejudice that this is a theoretical invention or—worse still—sheer mythology, I must emphasize that the concept of the anima is a purely empirical concept, whose sole purpose is to give a name to a group of related or analogous psychic phenomenaThe concept does no more and means no more than, shall we say, the concept arthropods, which includes all animals with articulated body and limbs and so gives a name to this phenomenological groupThe prejudice I have mentioned stems, regrettable though this is, from ignoranceMy critics are not acquainted with the phenomena in question, for these lie mostly outside the pale of merely medical knowledge, in a realm of universal human experienceBut the psyche, which the medical man has to do with, does not worry about the limitations of his knowledge; it manifests a life of its own and reacts to influences coming from every field of human experienceIts nature shows itself not merely in the personal sphere, or in the instinctual or social, but in phenomena of world-wide distributionSo if we want to understand the psyche, we have to include the whole worldFor practical reasons we can, indeed must, delimit our fields of work, but this should be done only with the conscious recognition of limitationThe more complex the phenomena which we have to do with in practical treatment, the wider must be our frame of reference and the greater the corresponding knowledge.
Anyone, therefore, who does not know the universal distribution and significance of the syzygy motif in the psychology of primitives, in mythology, in comparative religion, and in the history of literature, can hardly claim to say anything about the concept of the animaHis knowledge of the psychology of the neuroses may give him some idea of it, but it is only a knowledge of its general phenomenology that could open his eyes to the real meaning of what he encounters in individual cases, often in pathologically distorted form.
Although common prejudice still believes that the sole essential basis of our knowledge is given exclusively from outside, and that nihil est in intellectu quod non antea fuerit in sensu, it nevertheless remains true that the thoroughly respectable atomic theory of Leucippus and Democritus was not based on any observations of atomic fission but on a mythological conception of smallest particles, which, as the smallest animated parts, the soul-atoms, are known even to the still palaeolithic inhabitants of central AustraliaHow much soul is projected into the unknown in the world of external appearances is, of course, familiar to anyone acquainted with the natural science and natural philosophy of the ancientsIt is, in fact, so much that we are absolutely incapable of saying how the world is constituted in itself—and always shall be, since we are obliged to convert physical events into psychic processes as soon as we want to say anything about knowledgeBut who can guarantee that this conversion produces anything like an adequate objective picture of the world? That could only be if the physical event were also a psychic oneBut a great distance still seems to separate us from such an assertionTill then, we must for better or worse content ourselves with the assumption that the psyche supplies those images and forms which alone make knowledge of objects possible.
These forms are generally supposed to be transmitted by tradition, so that we speak of atoms today because we have heard, directly or indirectly, of the atomic theory of DemocritusBut where did Democritus, or whoever first spoke of minimal constitutive elements, hear of atoms? This notion had its origin in archetypal ideas, that is, in primordial images which were never reflections of physical events but are spontaneous products of the psychic factorDespite the materialistic tendency to understand the psyche as a mere reflection or imprint of physical and chemical processes, there is not a single proof of this hypothesisQuite the contrary, innumerable facts prove that the psyche translates physical processes into sequences of images which have hardly any recognizable connection with the objective processThe materialistic hypothesis is much too bold and flies in the face of experience with almost metaphysical presumptionThe only thing that can be established with certainty, in the present state of our knowledge, is our ignorance of the nature of the psycheThere is thus no ground at all for regarding the psyche as something secondary or as an epiphenomenon; on the contrary, there is every reason to regard it, at least hypothetically, as a factor sui generis, and to go on doing so until it has been sufficiently proved that psychic processes can be fabricated in a retortWe have laughed at the claims of the alchemists to be able to manufacture a lapis philosophorum consisting of body, soul, and spirit, as impossible, hence we should stop dragging along with us the logical consequence of this medieval assumption, namely the materialistic prejudice regarding the psyche, as though it were a proven fact.
It will not be so easy to reduce complex psychic facts to a chemical formulaHence the psychic factor must, ex hypothesi, be regarded for the present as an autonomous reality of enigmatic character, primarily because, judging from all we know, it appears to be essentially different from physicochemical processesEven if we do not ultimately know what its substantiality is, this is equally true of physical objects and of matter in generalSo if we regard the psyche as an independent factor, we must logically conclude that there is a psychic life which is not subject to the caprices of our willIf, then, those qualities of elusiveness, superficiality, shadowiness, and indeed of futility attach to anything psychic, this is primarily true of the subjective psychic, i.e., the contents of consciousness, but not of the objective psychic, the unconscious, which is an a priori conditioning factor of consciousness and its contentsFrom the unconscious there emanate determining influences which, independently of tradition, guarantee in every single individual a similarity and even a sameness of experience, and also of the way it is represented imaginativelyOne of the main proofs of this is the almost universal parallelism between mythological motifs, which, on account of their quality as primordial images, I have called archetypes.
One of these archetypes, which is of paramount practical importance for the psychotherapist, I have named the animaThis Latin expression is meant to connote something that should not be confused with any dogmatic Christian idea of the soul or with any of the previous philosophical conceptions of itIf one wishes to form anything like a concrete conception of what this term covers, one would do better to go back to a classical author like Macrobius, or to classical Chinese philosophy, where the anima (p'o or kuei) is regarded as the feminine and chthonic part of the soulA parallel of this kind always runs the risk of metaphysical concretism, which I do my best to avoid, though any attempt at graphic description is bound to succumb to it up to a pointFor we are dealing here not with an abstract concept but with an empirical one, and the form in which it appears necessarily clings to it, so that it cannot be described at all except in terms of its specific phenomenology.
Unperturbed by the philosophical pros and cons of the age, a scientific psychology must regard those transcendental intuitions that sprang from the human mind in all ages as projections, that is, as psychic contents that were extrapolated in metaphysical space and hypostatizedWe encounter the anima historically above all in the divine syzygies, the male-female pairs of deitiesThese reach down, on the one side, into the obscurities of primitive mythology, and up, on the other, into the philosophical speculations of Gnosticism and of classical Chinese philosophy, where the cosmogonic pair of concepts are designated yang (masculine) and yin (feminine)We can safely assert that these syzygies are as universal as the existence of man and womanFrom this fact we may reasonably conclude that man's imagination is bound by this motif, so that he was largely compelled to project it again and again, at all times and in all places.
Now, as we know from psychotherapeutic experience, projection is an unconscious, automatic process whereby a content that is unconscious to the subject transfers itself to an object, so that it seems to belong to that objectThe projection ceases the moment it becomes conscious, that is to say when it is seen as belonging to the subjectThus the polytheistic heaven of the ancients owes its depotentiation not least to the view first propounded by Euhemeros, who maintained that the gods were nothing but reflections of human characterIt is indeed easy to show that the divine pair is simply an idealization of the parents or of some other human couple, which for some reason appeared in heavenThis assumption would be simple enough if projection were not an unconscious process but were a conscious intentionIt would generally be supposed that one's own parents are the best known of all individuals, the ones of which the subject is most consciousBut precisely for this reason they could not be projected, because projection always contains something of which the subject is not conscious and which seems not to belong to himThe image of the parents is the very one that could be projected least, because it is too conscious.
In reality, however, it is just the parental imagos that seem to be projected most frequently, a fact so obvious that one could almost draw the conclusion that it is precisely the conscious contents which are projectedThis can be seen most plainly in cases of transference, where it is perfectly clear to the patient that the father-imago (or even the mother-imago) is projected on to the analyst and he even sees through the incest-fantasies bound up with them, without, however, being freed from the reactive effect of his projection, i.e., from the transferenceIn other words, he behaves exactly as if he had not seen through his projection at allExperience shows that projection is never conscious: projections are always there first and are recognized afterwardsWe must therefore assume that, over and above the incest-fantasy, highly emotional contents are still bound up with the parental imagos and need to be made consciousThey are obviously more difficult to make conscious than the incest-fantasies, which are supposed to have been repressed through violent resistance and to be unconscious for that reasonSupposing this view is correct, we are driven to the conclusion that besides the incest-fantasy there must be contents which are repressed through a still greater resistanceSince it is difficult to imagine anything more repellent than incest, we find ourselves rather at a loss to answer this question.
If we let practical experience speak, it tells us that, apart from the incest-fantasy, religious ideas are associated with the parental imagosI do not need to cite historical proofs of this, as they are known to allBut what about the alleged objectionableness of religious associations?
Someone once observed that in ordinary society it is more embarrassing to talk about God at table than to tell a risqué storyIndeed, for many people it is more bearable to admit their sexual fantasies than to be forced to confess that their analyst is a saviour, for the former are biologically legitimate, whereas the latter instance is definitely pathological, and this is something we greatly fearIt seems to me, however, that we make too much of resistance. The phenomena in question can be explained just as easily by lack of imagination and reflectiveness, which makes the act of conscious realization so difficult for the patientHe may perhaps have no particular resistance to religious ideas, only the thought has never occurred to him that he could seriously regard his analyst as a God or saviourMere reason alone is sufficient to protect him from such illusionsBut he is less slow to assume that his analyst thinks himself oneWhen one is dogmatic oneself, it is notoriously easy to take other people for prophets and founders of religions.
Now religious ideas, as history shows, are charged with an extremely suggestive, emotional powerAmong them I naturally reckon all représentations collectives, everything that we learn from the history of religion, and anything that has an -ism attached to itThe latter is only a modern variant of the denominational religionsA man may be convinced in all good faith that he has no religious ideas, but no one can fall so far away from humanity that he no longer has any dominating représentation collectiveHis very materialism, atheism, communism, socialism, liberalism, intellectualism, existentialism, or what not, testifies against his innocenceSomewhere or other, overtly or covertly, he is possessed by a supraordinate idea.
The psychologist knows how much religious ideas have to do with the parental imagosHistory has preserved overwhelming evidence of this, quite apart from modern medical findings, which have even led certain people to suppose that the relationship to the parents is the real origin of religious ideasThis hypothesis is based on very poor knowledge of the factsIn the first place, one should not simply translate the family psychology of modern man into a context of primitive conditions, where things are so very different; secondly, one should beware of ill-considered tribal-father and primal-horde fantasies; thirdly and most importantly, one should have the most accurate knowledge of the phenomenology of religious experience, which is a subject in itselfPsychological investigations in this field have so far not fulfilled any of these three conditions.
The only thing we know positively from psychological experience is that theistic ideas are associated with the parental imagos, and that our patients are mostly unconscious of themIf the corresponding projections cannot be withdrawn through insight, then we have every reason to suspect the presence of emotional contents of a religious nature, regardless of the rationalistic resistance of the patient.
So far as we have any information about man, we know that he has always and everywhere been under the influence of dominating ideasAny one who alleges that he is not can immediately be suspected of having exchanged a known form of belief for a variant which is less known both to himself and to othersInstead of theism he is a devotee of atheism, instead of Dionysus he favours the more modern Mithras, and instead of heaven he seeks paradise on earth.
A man without a dominating représentation collective would be a thoroughly abnormal phenomenonBut such a person exists only in the fantasies of isolated individuals who are deluded about themselvesThey are mistaken not only about the existence of religious ideas, but also and more especially about their intensityThe archetype behind a religious idea has, like every instinct, its specific energy, which it does not lose even if the conscious mind ignores itJust as it can be assumed with the greatest probability that every man possesses all the average human functions and qualities, so we may expect the presence of normal religious factors, the archetypes, and this expectation does not prove fallaciousAny one who succeeds in putting off the mantle of faith can do so only because another lies close to handNo one can escape the prejudice of being human.
The représentations collectives have a dominating power, so it is not surprising that they are repressed with the most intense resistanceWhen repressed, they do not hide behind any trifling thing but behind ideas and figures that have already become problematical for other reasons, and intensify and complicate their dubious natureFor instance, everything that we would like, in infantile fashion, to attribute to our parents or blame them for is blown up to fantastic proportions from this secret source, and for this reason it remains an open question how much of the ill-reputed incest-fantasy is to be taken seriouslyBehind the parental pair, or pair of lovers, lie contents of extreme tension which are not apperceived in consciousness and can therefore become perceptible only through projectionThat projections of this kind do actually occur and are not just traditional opinions is attested by historical documentsThese show that syzygies were projected which were in complete contradiction to the traditional beliefs, and that they were often experienced in the form of a vision.
One of the most instructive examples in this respect is the vision of the recently canonized Nicholas of Flüe, a Swiss mystic of the fifteenth century, of whose visions we possess reports by his contemporariesIn the visions that marked his initiation into the state of adoption by God, God appeared in dual form, once as a majestic father and once as a majestic motherThis representation could not be more unorthodox, since the Church had eliminated the feminine element from the Trinity a thousand years earlier as hereticalBrother Klaus was a simple unlettered peasant who doubtless had received none but the approved Church teaching, and was certainly not acquainted with the Gnostic interpretation of the Holy Ghost as the feminine and motherly SophiaHis so-called Trinity Vision is at the same time a perfect example of the intensity of projected contentsBrother Klaus's psychological situation was eminently suited to a projection of this kind, for his conscious idea of God was so little in accord with the unconscious content that the latter had to appear in the form of an alien and shattering experienceWe must conclude from this that it was not the traditional idea of God but, on the contrary, an heretical image that realized itself in visionary form; an archetypal interpretation which came to life again spontaneously, independently of traditionIt was the archetype of the divine pair, the syzygy.
There is a very similar case in the visions of Guillaume de Digulleville, which are described in Le Pèlerinage de l'âmeHe saw God in the highest heaven as the King on a shining round throne, and beside him sat the Queen of Heaven on a throne of brown crystalFor a monk of the Cistercian Order, which as we know is distinguished for its severity, this vision is exceedingly hereticalSo here again the condition for projection is fulfilled.
Another impressive account of the syzygy vision can be found in the work of Edward Maitland, who wrote the biography of Anna KingsfordThere he describes in detail his own experience of God, which, like that of Brother Klaus, consisted in a vision of lightHe says: This was … God as the Lord, proving by His duality that God is Substance as well as Force, Love as well as Will, feminine as well as masculine, Mother as well as Father.
These few examples may suffice to characterize the experience of projection and those features of it which are independent of traditionWe can hardly get round the hypothesis that an emotionally charged content is lying ready in the unconscious and springs into projection at a certain momentThis content is the syzygy motif, and it expresses the fact that a masculine element is always paired with a feminine oneThe wide distribution and extraordinary emotionality of this motif prove that it is a fundamental psychic factor of great practical importance, no matter whether the individual psychotherapist or psychologist understands where and in what way it influences his special field of workMicrobes, as we know, played their dangerous role long before they were discovered.
As I have said, it is natural to suspect the parental pair in all syzygiesThe feminine part, the mother, corresponds to the animaBut since, for the reasons discussed above, consciousness of the object prevents its projection, there is nothing for it but to assume that parents are also the least known of all human beings, and consequently that an unconscious reflection of the parental pair exists which is as unlike them, as utterly alien and incommensurable, as a man compared with a godIt would be conceivable, and has as we know been asserted, that the unconscious reflection is none other than the image of father and mother that was acquired in early childhood, overvalued, and later repressed on account of the incest-fantasy associated with itThis hypothesis presupposes that the image was once conscious, otherwise it could not have been repressed. It also presupposes that the act of moral repression has itself become unconscious, for otherwise the act would remain preserved in consciousness together with the memory of the repressive moral reaction, from which the nature of the thing repressed could easily be recognizedI do not want to enlarge on these misgivings, but would merely like to emphasize that there is general agreement on one point: that the parental imago comes into existence not in the pre-puberal period or at a time when consciousness is more or less developed, but in the initial stages between the first and fourth year, when consciousness does not show any real continuity and is characterized by a kind of island-like discontinuityThe ego-relationship that is required for continuity of consciousness is present only in part, so that a large proportion of psychic life at this stage runs on in a state which can only be described as relatively unconsciousAt all events it is a state which would give the impression of a somnambulistic, dream, or twilight state if observed in an adultThese states, as we know from the observation of small children, are always characterized by an apperception of reality filled with fantasiesThe fantasy-images outweigh the influence of sensory stimuli and mould them into conformity with a pre-existing psychic image.
It is in my view a great mistake to suppose that the psyche of a new-born child is a tabula rasa in the sense that there is absolutely nothing in itIn so far as the child is born with a differentiated brain that is predetermined by heredity and therefore individualized, it meets sensory stimuli coming from outside not with any aptitudes, but with specific ones, and this necessarily results in a particular, individual choice and pattern of apperceptionThese aptitudes can be shown to be inherited instincts and preformed patterns, the latter being the a priori and formal conditions of apperception that are based on instinctTheir presence gives the world of the child and the dreamer its anthropomorphic stampThey are the archetypes, which direct all fantasy activity into its appointed paths and in this way produce, in the fantasy-images of children's dreams as well as in the delusions of schizophrenia, astonishing mythological parallels such as can also be found, though in lesser degree, in the dreams of normal persons and neuroticsIt is not, therefore, a question of inherited ideas but of inherited possibilities of ideasNor are they individual acquisitions but, in the main, common to all, as can be seen from the universal occurrence of the archetypes.
Just as the archetypes occur on the ethnological level as myths, so also they are found in every individual, and their effect is always strongest, that is, they anthropomorphize reality most, where consciousness is weakest and most restricted, and where fantasy can overrun the facts of the outer worldThis condition is undoubtedly present in the child during the first years of its lifeIt therefore seems to me more probable that the archetypal form of the divine syzygy first covers up and assimilates the image of the real parents until, with increasing consciousness, the real figures of the parents are perceived—often to the child's disappointmentNobody knows better than the psychotherapist that the mythologizing of the parents is often pursued far into adulthood and is given up only with the greatest resistance.
I remember a case that was presented to me as the victim of a high-grade mother and castration complex, which had still not been overcome in spite of psychoanalysisWithout any hint from me, the man had made some drawings which showed the mother first as a superhuman being, and then as a figure of woe, with bloody mutilationsI was especially struck by the fact that a castration had obviously been performed on the mother, for in front of her gory genitals lay the cut-off male sexual organsThe drawings clearly represented a diminishing climax: first the mother was a divine hermaphrodite, who then, through the son's disappointing experience of reality, was robbed of its androgynous, Platonic perfection and changed into the woeful figure of an ordinary old womanThus from the very beginning, from the son's earliest childhood, the mother was assimilated to the archetypal idea of the syzygy, or conjunction of male and female, and for this reason appeared perfect and superhumanThe latter quality invariably attaches to the archetype and explains why the archetype appears strange and as if not belonging to consciousness, and also why, if the subject identifies with it, it often causes a devastating change of personality, generally in the form of megalomania or its opposite.
The son's disappointment effected a castration of the hermaphroditic mother: this was the patient's so-called castration complexHe had tumbled down from his childhood Olympus and was no longer the son-hero of a divine motherHis so-called fear of castration was fear of real life, which refused to come up to his erstwhile childish expectations, and everywhere lacked that mythological meaning which he still dimly remembered from his earliest youthHis life was, in the truest sense of the word, godless. And that, for him—though he did not realize it—meant a dire loss of hope and energyHe thought of himself as castrated, which is a very plausible neurotic misunderstanding—so plausible that it could even be turned into a theory of neurosis.
Because people have always feared that the connection with the instinctive, archetypal stage of consciousness might get lost in the course of life, the custom has long since been adopted of giving the new-born child, in addition to his bodily parents, two godparents, a godfather and a godmother, who are supposed to be responsible for the spiritual welfare of their godchildThey represent the pair of gods who appear at its birth, thus illustrating the dual birth motif.
The anima image, which lends the mother such superhuman glamour in the eyes of the son, gradually becomes tarnished by commonplace reality and sinks back into the unconscious, but without in any way losing its original tension and instinctivityIt is ready to spring out and project itself at the first opportunity, the moment a woman makes an impression that is out of the ordinaryWe then have Goethe's experience with Frau von Stein, and its repercussions in the figures of Mignon and Gretchen, all over againIn the case of Gretchen, Goethe also showed us the whole underlying metaphysic. The love life of a man reveals the psychology of this archetype in the form either of boundless fascination, overvaluation, and infatuation, or of misogyny in all its gradations and variants, none of which can be explained by the real nature of the object in question, but only by a transference of the mother complexThe complex, however, was caused in the first place by the assimilation of the mother (in itself a normal and ubiquitous phenomenon) to the pre-existent, feminine side of an archetypal male-female pair of opposites, and secondly by an abnormal delay in detaching from the primordial image of the motherActually, nobody can stand the total loss of the archetypeWhen that happens, it gives rise to that frightful discontent in our culture, where nobody feels at home because a father and mother are missingEveryone knows the provisions that religion has always made in this respectUnfortunately there are very many people who thoughtlessly go on asking whether these provisions are true, when it is really a question of a psychological needNothing is achieved by explaining them away rationalistically.
When projected, the anima always has a feminine form with definite characteristicsThis empirical finding does not mean that the archetype is constituted like that in itselfThe male-female syzygy is only one among the possible pairs of opposites, albeit the most important one in practice and the commonestIt has numerous connections with other pairs which do not display any sex differences at all and can therefore be put into the sexual category only by main forceThese connections, with their manifold shades of meaning, are found more particularly in Kundalini yoga, in Gnosticism, and above all in alchemical philosophy, quite apart from the spontaneous fantasy-products in neurotic and psychotic case materialWhen one carefully considers this accumulation of data, it begins to seem probable that an archetype in its quiescent, unprojected state has no exactly determinable form but is in itself an indefinite structure which can assume definite forms only in projection.
This seems to contradict the concept of a type. If I am not mistaken, it not only seems but actually is a contradictionEmpirically speaking, we are dealing all the time with types, definite forms that can be named and distinguishedBut as soon as you divest these types of the phenomenology presented by the case material, and try to examine them in relation to other archetypal forms, they branch out into such far-reaching ramifications in the history of symbols that one comes to the conclusion that the basic psychic elements are infinitely varied and ever changing, so as utterly to defy our powers of imaginationThe empiricist must therefore content himself with a theoretical as if. In this respect he is no worse off than the atomic physicist, even though his method is not based on quantitative measurement but is a morphologically descriptive one.
The anima is a factor of the utmost importance in the psychology of a man wherever emotions and affects are at workShe intensifies, exaggerates, falsifies, and mythologizes all emotional relations with his work and with other people of both sexesThe resultant fantasies and entanglements are all her doingWhen the anima is strongly constellated, she softens the man's character and makes him touchy, irritable, moody, jealous, vain, and unadjustedHe is then in a state of discontent and spreads discontent all around himSometimes the man's relationship to the woman who has caught his anima accounts for the existence of this syndrome.
The anima, as I have remarked elsewhere, has not escaped the attentions of the poetsThere are excellent descriptions of her, which at the same time tell us about the symbolic context in which the archetype is usually embeddedI give first place to Rider Haggard's novels She, The Return of She, and Wisdom's Daughter, and Benoît's L' AtlantideBenoît was accused of plagiarizing Rider Haggard, because the two accounts are disconcertingly alikeBut it seems he was able to acquit himself of this chargeSpitteler's Prometheus contains some very subtle observations, too, and his novel Imago gives an admirable description of projection.
The question of therapy is a problem that cannot be disposed of in a few wordsIt was not my intention to deal with it here, but I would like to outline my point of viewYounger people, who have not yet reached the middle of life (around the age of ), can bear even the total loss of the anima without injuryThe important thing at this stage is for a man to be a manThe growing youth must be able to free himself from the anima fascination of his motherThere are exceptions, notably artists, where the problem often takes a different turn; also homosexuality, which is usually characterized by identity with the animaIn view of the recognized frequency of this phenomenon, its interpretation as a pathological perversion is very dubiousThe psychological findings show that it is rather a matter of incomplete detachment from the hermaphroditic archetype, coupled with a distinct resistance to identify with the role of a one-sided sexual beingSuch a disposition should not be adjudged negative in all circumstances, in so far as it preserves the archetype of the Original Man, which a one-sided sexual being has, up to a point, lost.
After the middle of life, however, permanent loss of the anima means a diminution of vitality, of flexibility, and of human kindnessThe result, as a rule, is premature rigidity, crustiness, stereotypy, fanatical one-sidedness, obstinacy, pedantry, or else resignation, weariness, sloppiness, irresponsibility, and finally a childish ramollissement with a tendency to alcoholAfter middle life, therefore, the connection with the archetypal sphere of experience should if possible be re-established.
The concept of the Great Mother belongs to the field of comparative religion and embraces widely varying types of mother-goddessThe concept itself is of no immediate concern to psychology, because the image of a Great Mother in this form is rarely encountered in practice, and then only under very special conditionsThe symbol is obviously a derivative of the mother archetypeIf we venture to investigate the background of the Great Mother image from the standpoint of psychology, then the mother archetype, as the more inclusive of the two, must form the basis of our discussionThough lengthy discussion of the concept of an archetype is hardly necessary at this stage, some preliminary remarks of a general nature may not be out of place.
In former times, despite some dissenting opinion and the influence of Aristotle, it was not too difficult to understand Plato's conception of the Idea as supraordinate and pre-existent to all phenomenaArchetype, far from being a modern term, was already in use before the time of StAugustine, and was synonymous with Idea in the Platonic usageWhen the Corpus Hermeticum, which probably dates from the third century, describes God as τò àρέéτυπov φς, the archetypal light,' it expresses the idea that he is the prototype of all light; that is to say, pre-existent and supraordinate to the phenomenon light. Were I a philosopher, I should continue in this Platonic strain and say: Somewhere, in a place beyond the skies, there is a prototype or primordial image of the mother that is pre-existent and supraordinate to all phenomena in which the maternal, in the broadest sense of the term, is manifestBut I am an empiricist, not a philosopher; I cannot let myself presuppose that my peculiar temperament, my own attitude to intellectual problems, is universally validApparently this is an assumption in which only the philosopher may indulge, who always takes it for granted that his own disposition and attitude are universal, and will not recognize the fact, if he can avoid it, that his personal equation conditions his philosophyAs an empiricist, I must point out that there is a temperament which regards ideas as real entities and not merely as nominaIt so happens—by the merest accident, one might say—that for the past two hundred years we have been living in an age in which it has become unpopular or even unintelligible to suppose that ideas could be anything but nominaAnyone who continues to think as Plato did must pay for his anachronism by seeing the supracelestial, i.e., metaphysical, essence of the Idea relegated to the unverifiable realm of faith and superstition, or charitably left to the poetOnce again, in the age-old controversy over universals, the nominalistic standpoint has triumphed over the realistic, and the Idea has evaporated into a mere flatus vocisThis change was accompanied—and, indeed, to a considerable degree caused—by the marked rise of empiricism, the advantages of which were only too obvious to the intellectSince that time the Idea is no longer something a priori, but is secondary and derivedNaturally, the new nominalism promptly claimed universal validity for itself in spite of the fact that it, too, is based on a definite and limited thesis coloured by temperamentThis thesis runs as follows: we accept as valid anything that comes from outside and can be verifiedThe ideal instance is verification by experimentThe antithesis is: we accept as valid anything that comes from inside and cannot be verifiedThe hopelessness of this position is obviousGreek natural philosophy with its interest in matter, together with Aristotelian reasoning, has achieved a belated but overwhelming victory over Plato.
Yet every victory contains the germ of future defeatIn our own day signs foreshadowing a change of attitude are rapidly increasingSignificantly enough, it is Kant's doctrine of categories, more than anything else, that destroys in embryo every attempt to revive metaphysics in the old sense of the word, but at the same time paves the way for a rebirth of the Platonic spiritIf it be true that there can be no metaphysics transcending human reason, it is no less true that there can be no empirical knowledge that is not already caught and limited by the a priori structure of cognitionDuring the century and a half that have elapsed since the appearance of the Critique of Pure Reason, the conviction has gradually gained ground that thinking, understanding, and reasoning cannot be regarded as independent processes subject only to the eternal laws of logic, but that they are psychic functions co-ordinated with the personality and subordinate to itWe no longer ask, Has this or that been seen, heard, handled, weighed, counted, thought, and found to be logical? We ask instead, Who saw, heard, or thought? Beginning with the personal equation in the observation and measurement of minimal processes, this critical attitude has gone on to the creation of an empirical psychology such as no time before ours has knownToday we are convinced that in all fields of knowledge psychological premises exist which exert a decisive influence upon the choice of material, the method of investigation, the nature of the conclusions, and the formulation of hypotheses and theoriesWe have even come to believe that Kant's personality was a decisive conditioning factor of his Critique of Pure ReasonNot only our philosophers, but our own predilections in philosophy, and even what we are fond of calling our best truths are affected, if not dangerously undermined, by this recognition of a personal premiseAll creative freedom, we cry out, is taken away from us! What? Can it be possible that a man only thinks or says or does what he himself is?
Provided that we do not again exaggerate and so fall a victim to unrestrained psychologizing, it seems to me that the critical standpoint here defined is inescapableIt constitutes the essence, origin, and method of modern psychologyThere is an a priori factor in all human activities, namely the inborn, preconscious and unconscious individual structure of the psycheThe preconscious psyche—for example, that of a new-born infant—is not an empty vessel into which, under favourable conditions, practically anything can be pouredOn the contrary, it is a tremendously complicated, sharply defined individual entity which appears indeterminate to us only because we cannot see it directlyBut the moment the first visible manifestations of psychic life begin to appear, one would have to be blind not to recognize their individual character, that is, the unique personality behind themIt is hardly possible to suppose that all these details come into being only at the moment in which they appearWhen it is a case of morbid predispositions already present in the parents, we infer hereditary transmission through the germ-plasm; it would not occur to us to regard epilepsy in the child of an epileptic mother as an unaccountable mutationAgain, we explain by heredity the gifts and talents which can be traced back through whole generationsWe explain in the same way the reappearance of complicated instinctive actions in animals that have never set eyes on their parents and therefore could not possibly have been taught by them.
Nowadays we have to start with the hypothesis that, so far as predisposition is concerned, there is no essential difference between man and all other creaturesLike every animal, he possesses a preformed psyche which breeds true to his species and which, on closer examination, reveals distinct features traceable to family antecedentsWe have not the slightest reason to suppose that there are certain human activities or functions that could be exempted from this ruleWe are unable to form any idea of what those dispositions or aptitudes are which make instinctive actions in animals possibleAnd it is just as impossible for us to know the nature of the preconscious psychic disposition that enables a child to react in a human mannerWe can only suppose that his behaviour results from patterns of functioning, which I have described as imagesThe term image is intended to express not only the form of the activity taking place, but the typical situation in which the activity is releasedThese images are primordial images in so far as they are peculiar to whole species, and if they ever originated their origin must have coincided at least with the beginning of the speciesThey are the human quality of the human being, the specifically human form his activities takeThis specific form is hereditary and is already present in the germ-plasmThe idea that it is not inherited but comes into being in every child anew would be just as preposterous as the primitive belief that the sun which rises in the morning is a different sun from that which set the evening before.
Since everything psychic is preformed, this must also be true of the individual functions, especially those which derive directly from the unconscious predispositionThe most important of these is creative fantasyIn the products of fantasy the primordial images are made visible, and it is here that the concept of the archetype finds its specific applicationI do not claim to have been the first to point out this factThe honour belongs to PlatoThe first investigator in the field of ethnology to draw attention to the widespread occurrence of certain elementary ideas was Adolf BastianTwo later investigators, Hubert and Mauss, followers of Dürkheim, speak of categories of the imaginationAnd it was no less an authority than Hermann Usener who first recognized unconscious preformation under the guise of unconscious thinking. If I have any share in these discoveries, it consists in my having shown that archetypes are not disseminated only by tradition, language, and migration, but that they can rearise spontaneously, at any time, at any place, and without any outside influence.
The far-reaching implications of this statement must not be overlookedFor it means that there are present in every psyche forms which are unconscious but nonetheless active—living dispositions, ideas in the Platonic sense, that preform and continually influence our thoughts and feelings and actions.
Again and again I encounter the mistaken notion that an archetype is determined in regard to its content, in other words that it is a kind of unconscious idea (if such an expression be admissible)It is necessary to point out once more that archetypes are not determined as regards their content, but only as regards their form and then only to a very limited degreeA primordial image is determined as to its content only when it has become conscious and is therefore filled out with the material of conscious experienceIts form, however, as I have explained elsewhere, might perhaps be compared to the axial system of a crystal, which, as it were, preforms the crystalline structure in the mother liquid, although it has no material existence of its ownThis first appears according to the specific way in which the ions and molecules aggregateThe archetype in itself is empty and purely formal, nothing but a facultas praeformandi, apossibility of representation which is given a prioriThe representations themselves are not inherited, only the forms, and in that respect they correspond in every way to the instincts, which are also determined in form onlyThe existence of the instincts can no more be proved than the existence of the archetypes, so long as they do not manifest themselves concretelyWith regard to the definiteness of the form, our comparison with the crystal is illuminating inasmuch as the axial system determines only the stereometric structure but not the concrete form of the individual crystalThis may be either large or small, and it may vary endlessly by reason of the different size of its planes or by the growing together of two crystalsThe only thing that remains constant is the axial system, or rather, the invariable geometric proportions underlying itThe same is true of the archetypeIn principle, it can be named and has an invariable nucleus of meaning—but always only in principle, never as regards its concrete manifestationIn the same way, the specific appearance of the mother-image at any given time cannot be deduced from the mother archetype alone, but depends on innumerable other factors.
Like any other archetype, the mother archetype appears under an almost infinite variety of aspectsI mention here only some of the more characteristicFirst in importance are the personal mother and grandmother, stepmother and mother-in-law; then any woman with whom a relationship exists—for example, a nurse or governess or perhaps a remote ancestressThen there are what might be termed mothers in a figurative senseTo this category belongs the goddess, and especially the Mother of God, the Virgin, and SophiaMythology offers many variations of the mother archetype, as for instance the mother who reappears as the maiden in the myth of Demeter and Kore; or the mother who is also the beloved, as in the Cybele-Attis mythOther symbols of the mother in a figurative sense appear in things representing the goal of our longing for redemption, such as Paradise, the Kingdom of God, the Heavenly JerusalemMany things arousing devotion or feelings of awe, as for instance the Church, university, city or country, heaven, earth, the woods, the sea or any still waters, matter even, the underworld and the moon, can be mother-symbolsThe archetype is often associated with things and places standing for fertility and fruitfulness: the cornucopia, a ploughed field, a gardenIt can be attached to a rock, a cave, a tree, a spring, a deep well, or to various vessels such as the baptismal font, or to vessel-shaped flowers like the rose or the lotusBecause of the protection it implies, the magic circle or mandala can be a form of mother archetypeHollow objects such as ovens and cooking vessels are associated with the mother archetype, and, of course, the uterus, yoni, and anything of a like shapeAdded to this list there are many animals, such as the cow, hare, and helpful animals in general.
All these symbols can have a positive, favourable meaning or a negative, evil meaningAn ambivalent aspect is seen in the goddesses of fate (Moira, Graeae, Norns)Evil symbols are the witch, the dragon (or any devouring and entwining animal, such as a large fish or a serpent), the grave, the sarcophagus, deep water, death, nightmares and bogies (Empusa, Lilith, etc.)This list is not, of course, complete; it presents only the most important features of the mother archetype.
The qualities associated with it are maternal solicitude and sympathy; the magic authority of the female; the wisdom and spiritual exaltation that transcend reason; any helpful instinct or impulse; all that is benign, all that cherishes and sustains, that fosters growth and fertilityThe place of magic transformation and rebirth, together with the underworld and its inhabitants, are presided over by the motherOn the negative side the mother archetype may connote anything secret, hidden, dark; the abyss, the world of the dead, anything that devours, seduces, and poisons, that is terrifying and inescapable like fateAll these attributes of the mother archetype have been fully described and documented in my book Symbols of TransformationThere I formulated the ambivalence of these attributes as the loving and the terrible mother. Perhaps the historical example of the dual nature of the mother most familiar to us is the Virgin Mary, who is not only the Lord's mother, but also, according to the medieval allegories, his crossIn India, the loving and terrible mother is the paradoxical KaliSankhya philosophy has elaborated the mother archetype into the concept of prakrti (matter) and assigned to it the three gunas or fundamental attributes: sattva, rajas, tamas: goodness, passion, and darknessThese are three essential aspects of the mother: her cherishing and nourishing goodness, her orgiastic emotionality, and her Stygian depthsThe special feature of the philosophical myth, which shows Prakrti dancing before Purusha in order to remind him of discriminating knowledge, does not belong to the mother archetype but to the archetype of the anima, which in a man's psychology invariably appears, at first, mingled with the mother-image.
Although the figure of the mother as it appears in folklore is more or less universal, this image changes markedly when it appears in the individual psycheIn treating patients one is at first impressed, and indeed arrested, by the apparent significance of the personal motherThis figure of the personal mother looms so large in all personalistic psychologies that, as we know, they never got beyond it, even in theory, to other important aetiological factorsMy own view differs from that of other medico-psychological theories principally in that I attribute to the personal mother only a limited aetiological significanceThat is to say, all those influences which the literature describes as being exerted on the children do not come from the mother herself, but rather from the archetype projected upon her, which gives her a mythological background and invests her with authority and numinosityThe aetiological and traumatic effects produced by the mother must be divided into two groups: () those corresponding to traits of character or attitudes actually present in the mother, and () those referring to traits which the mother only seems to possess, the reality being composed of more or less fantastic (i.e., archetypal) projections on the part of the childFreud himself had already seen that the real aetiology of neuroses does not lie in traumatic effects, as he at first suspected, but in a peculiar development of infantile fantasyThis is not to deny that such a development can be traced back to disturbing influences emanating from the motherI myself make it a rule to look first for the cause of infantile neuroses in the mother, as I know from experience that a child is much more likely to develop normally than neurotically, and that in the great majority of cases definite causes of disturbances can be found in the parents, especially in the motherThe contents of the child's abnormal fantasies can be referred to the personal mother only in part, since they often contain clear and unmistakable allusions which could not possibly have reference to human beingsThis is especially true where definitely mythological products are concerned, as is frequently the case in infantile phobias where the mother may appear as a wild beast, a witch, a spectre, an ogre, a hermaphrodite, and so onIt must be borne in mind, however, that such fantasies are not always of unmistakably mythological origin, and even if they are, they may not always be rooted in the unconscious archetype but may have been occasioned by fairytales or accidental remarksA thorough investigation is therefore indicated in each caseFor practical reasons, such an investigation cannot be made so readily with children as with adults, who almost invariably transfer their fantasies to the physician during treatment—or, to be more precise, the fantasies are projected upon him automatically.
When that happens, nothing is gained by brushing them aside as ridiculous, for archetypes are among the inalienable assets of every psycheThey form the treasure in the realm of shadowy thoughts of which Kant spoke, and of which we have ample evidence in the countless treasure motifs of mythologyAn archetype is in no sense just an annoying prejudice; it becomes so only when it is in the wrong placeIn themselves, archetypal images are among the highest values of the human psyche; they have peopled the heavens of all races from time immemorialTo discard them as valueless would be a distinct lossOur task is not, therefore, to deny the archetype, but to dissolve the projections, in order to restore their contents to the individual who has involuntarily lost them by projecting them outside himself.
The mother archetype forms the foundation of the so-called mother-complexIt is an open question whether a mother-complex can develop without the mother having taken part in its formation as a demonstrable causal factorMy own experience leads me to believe that the mother always plays an active part in the origin of the disturbance, especially in infantile neuroses or in neuroses whose aetiology undoubtedly dates back to early childhoodIn any event, the child's instincts are disturbed, and this constellates archetypes which, in their turn, produce fantasies that come between the child and its mother as an alien and often frightening elementThus, if the children of an overanxious mother regularly dream that she is a terrifying animal or a witch, these experiences point to a split in the child's psyche that predisposes it to a neurosis.
The effects of the mother-complex differ according to whether it appears in a son or a daughterTypical effects on the son are homosexuality and Don Juanism, and sometimes also impotenceIn homosexuality, the son's entire heterosexuality is tied to the mother in an unconscious form; in Don Juanism, he unconsciously seeks his mother in every woman he meetsThe effects of a mother-complex on the son may be seen in the ideology of the Cybele and Attis type: self-castration, madness, and early deathBecause of the difference in sex, a son's mother-complex does not appear in pure formThis is the reason why in every masculine mother-complex, side by side with the mother archetype, a significant role is played by the image of the man's sexual counterpart, the animaThe mother is the first feminine being with whom the man-to-be comes in contact, and she cannot help playing, overtly or covertly, consciously or unconsciously, upon the son's masculinity, just as the son in his turn grows increasingly aware of his mother's femininity, or unconsciously responds to it by instinctIn the case of the son, therefore, the simple relationships of identity or of resistance and differentiation are continually cut across by erotic attraction or repulsion, which complicates matters very considerablyI do not mean to say that for this reason the mother-complex of a son ought to be regarded as more serious than that of a daughterThe investigation of these complex psychic phenomena is still in the pioneer stageComparisons will not become feasible until we have some statistics at our disposal, and of these, so far, there is no sign.
Only in the daughter is the mother-complex clear and uncomplicatedHere we have to do either with an overdevelopment of feminine instincts indirectly caused by the mother, or with a weakening of them to the point of complete extinctionIn the first case, the preponderance of instinct makes the daughter unconscious of her own personality; in the latter, the instincts are projected upon the motherFor the present we must content ourselves with the statement that in the daughter a mother-complex either unduly stimulates or else inhibits the feminine instinct, and that in the son it injures the masculine instinct through an unnatural sexualization.
Since a mother-complex is a concept borrowed from psychopathology, it is always associated with the idea of injury and illnessBut if we take the concept out of its narrow psychopathological setting and give it a wider connotation, we can see that it has positive effects as wellThus a man with a mother-complex may have a finely differentiated Eros instead of, or in addition to, homosexuality(Something of this sort is suggested by Plato in his Symposium.) This gives him a great capacity for friendship, which often creates ties of astonishing tenderness between men and may even rescue friendship between the sexes from the limbo of the impossibleHe may have good taste and an aesthetic sense which are fostered by the presence of a feminine streakThen he may be supremely gifted as a teacher because of his almost feminine insight and tactHe is likely to have a feeling for history, and to be conservative in the best sense and cherish the values of the pastOften he is endowed with a wealth of religious feelings, which help to bring the ecclesia spiritualis into reality; and a spiritual receptivity which makes him responsive to revelation.
In the same way, what in its negative aspect is Don Juanism can appear positively as bold and resolute manliness; ambitious striving after the highest goals; opposition to all stupidity, narrow-mindedness, injustice, and laziness; willingness to make sacrifices for what is regarded as right, sometimes bordering on heroism; perseverance, inflexibility and toughness of will; a curiosity that does not shrink even from the riddles of the universe; and finally, a revolutionary spirit which strives to put a new face upon the world.
All these possibilities are reflected in the mythological motifs enumerated earlier as different aspects of the mother archetypeAs I have already dealt with the mother-complex of the son, including the anima complication, elsewhere, and my present theme is the archetype of the mother, in the following discussion I shall relegate masculine psychology to the background.
(a) Hypertrophy of the Maternal Element.—We have noted that in the daughter the mother-complex leads either to a hypertrophy of the feminine side or to its atrophyThe exaggeration of the feminine side means an intensification of all female instincts, above all the maternal instinctThe negative aspect is seen in the woman whose only goal is childbirthTo her the husband is obviously of secondary importance; he is first and foremost the instrument of procreation, and she regards him merely as an object to be looked after, along with children, poor relations, cats, dogs, and household furnitureEven her own personality is of secondary importance; she often remains entirely unconscious of it, for her life is lived in and through others, in more or less complete identification with all the objects of her careFirst she gives birth to the children, and from then on she clings to them, for without them she has no existence whatsoeverLike Demeter, she compels the gods by her stubborn persistence to grant her the right of possession over her daughterHer Eros develops exclusively as a maternal relationship while remaining unconscious as a personal oneAn unconscious Eros always expresses itself as will to powerWomen of this type, though continually living for others, are, as a matter of fact, unable to make any real sacrificeDriven by ruthless will to power and a fanatical insistence on their own maternal rights, they often succeed in annihilating not only their own personality but also the personal lives of their childrenThe less conscious such a mother is of her own personality, the greater and the more violent is her unconscious will to powerFor many such women Baubo rather than Demeter would be the appropriate symbolThe mind is not cultivated for its own sake but usually remains in its original condition, altogether primitive, unrelated, and ruthless, but also as true, and sometimes as profound, as Nature herselfShe herself does not know this and is therefore unable to appreciate the wittiness of her mind or to marvel philosophically at its profundity; like as not she will immediately forget what she has said.
(b) Overdevelopment of Eros.—It by no means follows that the complex induced in a daughter by such a mother must necessarily result in hypertrophy of the maternal instinctQuite the contrary, this instinct may be wiped out altogetherAs a substitute, an overdeveloped Eros results, and this almost invariably leads to an unconscious incestuous relationship with the fatherThe intensified Eros places an abnormal emphasis on the personality of othersJealousy of the mother and the desire to outdo her become the leitmotifs of subsequent undertakings, which are often disastrousA woman of this type loves romantic and sensational episodes for their own sake, and is interested in married men, less for themselves than for the fact that they are married and so give her an opportunity to wreck a marriage, that being the whole point of her manoeuvreOnce the goal is attained, her interest evaporates for lack of any maternal instinct, and then it will be someone else's turnThis type is noted for its remarkable unconsciousnessSuch women really seem to be utterly blind to what they are doing, which is anything but advantageous either for themselves or for their victimsI need hardly point out that for men with a passive Eros this type offers an excellent hook for anima projections.
(c) Identity with the Mother.—It a mother-complex in a woman does not produce an overdeveloped Eros, it leads to identification with the mother and to paralysis of the daughter's feminine initiativeA complete projection of her personality on to the mother then takes place, owing to the fact that she is unconscious both of her maternal instinct and of her ErosEverything which reminds her of motherhood, responsibility, personal relationships, and erotic demands arouses feelings of inferiority and compels her to run away—to her mother, naturally, who lives to perfection everything that seems unattainable to her daughterAs a sort of superwoman (admired involuntarily by the daughter), the mother lives out for her beforehand all that the girl might have lived for herselfShe is content to cling to her mother in selfless devotion, while at the same time unconsciously striving, almost against her will, to tyrannize over her, naturally under the mask of complete loyalty and devotionThe daughter leads a shadow-existence, often visibly sucked dry by her mother, and she prolongs her mother's life by a sort of continuous blood transfusionThese bloodless maidens are by no means immune to marriageOn the contrary, despite their shadowiness and passivity, they command a high price on the marriage marketFirst, they are so empty that a man is free to impute to them anything he fanciesIn addition, they are so unconscious that the unconscious puts out countless invisible feelers, veritable octopus-tentacles, that suck up all masculine projections; and this pleases men enormouslyAll that feminine indefiniteness is the longed-for counterpart of male decisiveness and single-mindedness, which can be satisfactorily achieved only if a man can get rid of everything doubtful, ambiguous, vague, and muddled by projecting it upon some charming example of feminine innocenceBecause of the woman's characteristic passivity, and the feelings of inferiority which make her continually play the injured innocent, the man finds himself cast in an attractive role: he has the privilege of putting up with the familiar feminine foibles with real superiority, and yet with forbearance, like a true knight(Fortunately, he remains ignorant of the fact that these deficiencies consist largely of his own projections.) The girl's notorious helplessness is a special attractionShe is so much an appendage of her mother that she can only flutter confusedly when a man approachesShe just doesn't know a thingShe is so inexperienced, so terribly in need of help, that even the gentlest swain becomes a daring abductor who brutally robs a loving mother of her daughterSuch a marvellous opportunity to pass himself off as a gay Lothario does not occur every day and therefore acts as a strong incentiveThis was how Pluto abducted Persephone from the inconsolable DemeterBut, by a decree of the gods, he had to surrender his wife every year to his mother-in-law for the summer season(The attentive reader will note that such legends do not come about by chance!)
(d) Resistance to the Mother.— These three extreme types are linked together by many intermediate stages, of which I shall mention only one important exampleIn the particular intermediate type I have in mind, the problem is less an overdevelopment or an inhibition of the feminine instincts than an overwhelming resistance to maternal supremacy, often to the exclusion of all elseIt is the supreme example of the negative mother-complexThe motto of this type is: Anything, so long as it is not like Mother! On one hand we have a fascination which never reaches the point of identification; on the other, an intensification of Eros which exhausts itself in jealous resistanceThis kind of daughter knows what she does not want, but is usually completely at sea as to what she would choose as her own fateAll her instincts are concentrated on the mother in the negative form of resistance and are therefore of no use to her in building her own lifeShould she get as far as marrying, either the marriage will be used for the sole purpose of escaping from her mother, or else a diabolical fate will present her with a husband who shares all the essential traits of her mother's characterAll instinctive processes meet with unexpected difficulties; either sexuality does not function properly, or the children are unwanted, or maternal duties seem unbearable, or the demands of marital life are responded to with impatience and irritationThis is quite natural, since none of it has anything to do with the realities of life when stubborn resistance to the power of the mother in every form has come to be life's dominating aimIn such cases one can often see the attributes of the mother archetype demonstrated in every detailFor example, the mother as representative of the family (or clan) causes either violent resistances or complete indifference to anything that comes under the head of family, community, society, convention, and the likeResistance to the mother as uterus often manifests itself in menstrual disturbances, failure of conception, abhorrence of pregnancy, hemorrhages and excessive vomiting during pregnancy, miscarriages, and so onThe mother as materia, matter,' may be at the back of these women's impatience with objects, their clumsy handling of tools and crockery and bad taste in clothes.
Again, resistance to the mother can sometimes result in a spontaneous development of intellect for the purpose of creating a sphere of interest in which the mother has no placeThis development springs from the daughter's own needs and not at all for the sake of a man whom she would like to impress or dazzle by a semblance of intellectual comradeshipIts real purpose is to break the mother's power by intellectual criticism and superior knowledge, so as to enumerate to her all her stupidities, mistakes in logic, and educational shortcomingsIntellectual development is often accompanied by the emergence of masculine traits in general.
The positive aspect of the first type of complex, namely the overdevelopment of the maternal instinct, is identical with that well-known image of the mother which has been glorified in all ages and all tonguesThis is the mother-love which is one of the most moving and unforgettable memories of cur lives, the mysterious root of all growth and change; the love that means homecoming, shelter, and the long silence from which everything begins and in which everything endsIntimately known and yet strange like Nature, lovingly tender and yet cruel like fate, joyous and untiring giver of life—mater dolorosa and mute implacable portal that closes upon the deadMother is mother-love, my experience and my secretWhy risk saying too much, too much that is false and inadequate and beside the point, about that human being who was our mother, the accidental carrier of that great experience which includes herself and myself and all mankind, and indeed the whole of created nature, the experience of life whose children we are? The attempt to say these things has always been made, and probably always will be; but a sensitive person cannot in all fairness load that enormous burden of meaning, responsibility, duty, heaven and hell, on to the shoulders of one frail and fallible human being—so deserving of love, indulgence, understanding, and forgiveness—who was our motherHe knows that the mother carries for us that inborn image of the mater natura and mater spiritualis, of the totality of life of which we are a small and helpless partNor should we hesitate for one moment to relieve the human mother of this appalling burden, for our own sakes as well as hersIt is just this massive weight of meaning that ties us to the mother and chains her to her child, to the physical and mental detriment of bothA mother-complex is not got rid of by blindly reducing the mother to human proportionsBesides that we run the risk of dissolving the experience Mother into atoms, thus destroying something supremely valuable and throwing away the golden key which a good fairy laid in our cradleThat is why mankind has always instinctively added the pre-existent divine pair to the personal parents—the god-father and god-mother of the newborn child—so that, from sheer unconsciousness or shortsighted rationalism, he should never forget himself so far as to invest his own parents with divinity.
The archetype is really far less a scientific problem than an urgent question of psychic hygieneEven if all proofs of the existence of archetypes were lacking, and all the clever people in the world succeeded in convincing us that such a thing could not possibly exist, we would have to invent them forthwith in order to keep our highest and most important values from disappearing into the unconsciousFor when these fall into the unconscious the whole elemental force of the original experience is lostWhat then appears in its place is fixation on the mother-imago; and when this has been sufficiently rationalized and corrected, we are tied fast to human reason and condemned from then on to believe exclusively in what is rationalThat is a virtue and an advantage on the one hand, but on the other a limitation and impoverishment, for it brings us nearer to the bleakness of doctrinairism and enlightenment. This Déesse Raison emits a deceptive light which illuminates only what we know already, but spreads a darkness over all those things which it would be most needful for us to know and become conscious ofThe more independent reason pretends to be, the more it turns into sheer intellectuality which puts doctrine in the place of reality and shows us man not as he is but how it wants him to be.
Whether he understands them or not, man must remain conscious of the world of the archetypes, because in it he is still a part of Nature and is connected with his own rootsA view of the world or a social order that cuts him off from the primordial images of life not only is no culture at all but, in increasing degree, is a prison or a stableIf the primordial images remain conscious in some form or other, the energy that belongs to them can flow freely into manBut when it is no longer possible to maintain contact with them, then the tremendous sum of energy stored up in these images, which is also the source of the fascination underlying the infantile parental complex, falls back into the unconsciousThe unconscious then becomes charged with a force that acts as an irresistible vis a tergo to whatever view or idea or tendency our intellect may choose to dangle enticingly before our desiring eyesIn this way man is delivered over to his conscious side, and reason becomes the arbiter of right and wrong, of good and evilI am far from wishing to belittle the divine gift of reason, man's highest facultyBut in the role of absolute tyrant it has no meaning—no more than light would have in a world where its counterpart, darkness, was absentMan would do well to heed the wise counsel of the mother and obey the inexorable law of nature which sets limits to every beingHe ought never to forget that the world exists only because opposing forces are held in equilibriumSo, too, the rational is counterbalanced by the irrational, and what is planned and purposed by what is.
This excursion into the realm of generalities was unavoidable, because the mother is the first world of the child and the last world of the adultWe are all wrapped as her children in the mantle of this great IsisBut let us now return to the different types of feminine mother-complexIt may seem strange that I am devoting so much more time to the mother-complex in woman than to its counterpart in manThe reason for this has already been mentioned: in a man, the mother-complex is never pure, it is always mixed with the anima archetype, and the consequence is that a man's statements about the mother are always emotionally prejudiced in the sense of showing animosity. Only in women is it possible to examine the effects of the mother archetype without admixture of animosity, and even this has prospects of success only when no compensating animus has developed.
I drew a very unfavourable picture of this type as we encounter it in the field of psychopathologyBut this type, uninviting as it appears, also has positive aspects which society could ill afford to do withoutIndeed, behind what is possibly the worst effect of this attitude, the unscrupulous wrecking of marriages, we can see an extremely significant and purposeful arrangement of natureThis type often develops in reaction to a mother who is wholly a thrall of nature, purely instinctive and therefore all-devouringSuch a mother is an anachronism, a throw-back to a primitive state of matriarchy where the man leads an insipid existence as a mere procreator and serf of the soilThe reactive intensification of the daughter's Eros is aimed at some man who ought to be rescued from the preponderance of the female-maternal element in his lifeA woman of this type instinctively intervenes when provoked by the unconsciousness of the marriage partnerShe will disturb that comfortable ease so dangerous to the personality of a man but frequently regarded by him as marital faithfulnessThis complacency leads to blank unconsciousness of his own personality and to those supposedly ideal marriages where he is nothing but Dad and she is nothing but Mom, and they even call each other thatThis is a slippery path that can easily degrade marriage to the level of a mere breeding-pen.
A woman of this type directs the burning ray of her Eros upon a man whose life is stifled by maternal solicitude, and by doing so she arouses a moral conflictYet without this there can be no consciousness of personalityBut why on earth, you may ask, should it be necessary for man to achieve, by hook or by crook, a higher level of consciousness? This is truly the crucial question, and I do not find the answer easyInstead of a real answer I can only make a confession of faith: I believe that, after thousands and millions of years, someone had to realize that this wonderful world of mountains and oceans, suns and moons, galaxies and nebulae, plants and animals, existsFrom a low hill in the Athi plains of East Africa I once watched the vast herds of wild animals grazing in soundless stillness, as they had done from time immemorial, touched only by the breath of a primeval worldI felt then as if I were the first man, the first creature, to know that all this isThe entire world round me was still in its primeval state; it did not know that it wasAnd then, in that one moment in which I came to know, the world sprang into being; without that moment it would never have beenAll Nature seeks this goal and finds it fulfilled in man, but only in the most highly developed and most fully conscious manEvery advance, even the smallest, along this path of conscious realization adds that much to the world.
There is no consciousness without discrimination of oppositesThis is the paternal principle, the Logos, which eternally struggles to extricate itself from the primal warmth and primal darkness of the maternal womb; in a word, from unconsciousnessDivine curiosity yearns to be born and does not shrink from conflict, suffering, or sinUnconsciousness is the primal sin, evil itself, for the LogosTherefore its first creative act of liberation is matricide, and the spirit that dared all heights and all depths must, as Synesius says, suffer the divine punishment, enchainment on the rocks of the CaucasusNothing can exist without its opposite; the two were one in the beginning and will be one again in the endConsciousness can only exist through continual recognition of the unconscious, just as everything that lives must pass through many deaths.
The stirring up of conflict is a Luciferian virtue in the true sense of the wordConflict engenders fire, the fire of affects and emotions, and like every other fire it has two aspects, that of combustion and that of creating lightOn the one hand, emotion is the alchemical fire whose warmth brings everything into existence and whose heat burns all superfluities to ashes (omnes superfluitates comburit)But on the other hand, emotion is the moment when steel meets flint and a spark is struck forth, for emotion is the chief source of consciousnessThere is no change from darkness to light or from inertia to movement without emotion.
The woman whose fate it is to be a disturbing element is not solely destructive, except in pathological casesNormally the disturber is herself caught in the disturbance; the worker of change is herself changed, and the glare of the fire she ignites both illuminates and enlightens all the victims of the entanglementWhat seemed a senseless upheaval becomes a process of purification:
The woman of the third type, who is so identified with the mother that her own instincts are paralysed through projection, need not on that account remain a hopeless nonentity foreverOn the contrary, if she is at all normal, there is a good chance of the empty vessel being filled by a potent anima projectionIndeed, the fate of such a woman depends on this eventuality; she can never find herself at all, not even approximately, without a man's help; she has to be literally abducted or stolen from her motherMoreover, she must play the role mapped out for her for a long time and with great effort, until she actually comes to loathe itIn this way she may perhaps discover who she really isSuch women may become devoted and self-sacrificing wives of husbands whose whole existence turns on their identification with a profession or a great talent, but who, for the rest, are unconscious and remain soSince they are nothing but masks themselves, the wife, too, must be able to play the accompanying part with a semblance of naturalnessBut these women sometimes have valuable gifts which remained undeveloped only because they were entirely unconscious of their own personalityThey may project the gift or talent upon a husband who lacks it himself, and then we have the spectacle of a totally insignificant man who seemed to have no chance whatsoever suddenly soaring as if on a magic carpet to the highest summits of achievementCherchez la femme, and you have the secret of his successThese women remind me—if I may be forgiven the impolite comparison—of hefty great bitches who turn tail before the smallest cur simply because he is a terrible male and it never occurs to them to bite him.
Finally, it should be remarked that emptiness is a great feminine secretIt is something absolutely alien to man; the chasm, the unplumbed depths, the yinThe pitifulness of this vacuous nonentity goes to his heart (I speak here as a man), and one is tempted to say that this constitutes the whole mystery of womanSuch a female is fate itselfA man may say what he likes about it; be for it or against it, or both at once; in the end he falls, absurdly happy, into this pit, or, if he doesn't, he has missed and bungled his only chance of making a man of himselfIn the first case one cannot disprove his foolish good luck to him, and in the second one cannot make his misfortune seem plausibleThe Mothers, the Mothers, how eerily it sounds! With this sigh, which seals the capitulation of the male as he approaches the realm of the Mothers, we will turn to the fourth type.
As a pathological phenomenon this type is an unpleasant, exacting, and anything but satisfactory partner for her husband, since she rebels in every fibre of her being against everything that springs from natural soilHowever, there is no reason why increasing experience of life should not teach her a thing or two, so that for a start she gives up fighting the mother in the personal and restricted senseBut even at her best she will remain hostile to all that is dark, unclear, and ambiguous, and will cultivate and emphasize everything certain and clear and reasonableExcelling her more feminine sister in her objectivity and coolness of judgment, she may become the friend, sister, and competent adviser of her husbandHer own masculine aspirations make it possible for her to have a human understanding of the individuality of her husband quite transcending the realm of the eroticThe woman with this type of mother-complex probably has the best chance of all to make her marriage an outstanding success during the second half of lifeBut this is true only if she succeeds in overcoming the hell of nothing but femininity, the chaos of the maternal womb, which is her greatest danger because of her negative complexAs we know, a complex can be really overcome only if it is lived out to the fullIn other words, if we are to develop further we have to draw to us and drink down to the very dregs what, because of our complexes, we have held at a distance.
This type started out in the world with averted face, like Lot's wife looking back on Sodom and GomorrahAnd all the while the world and life pass by her like a dream—an annoying source of illusions, disappointments, and irritations, all of which are due solely to the fact that she cannot bring herself to look straight ahead for onceBecause of her merely unconscious, reactive attitude toward reality, her life actually becomes dominated by what she fought hardest against—the exclusively maternal feminine aspectBut if she should later turn her face, she will see the world for the first time, so to speak, in the light of maturity, and see it embellished with all the colours and enchanting wonders of youth, and sometimes even of childhoodIt is a vision that brings knowledge and discovery of truth, the indispensable prerequisite for consciousnessA part of life was lost, but the meaning of life has been salvaged for her.
The woman who fights against her father still has the possibility of leading an instinctive, feminine existence, because she rejects only what is alien to herBut when she fights against the mother she may, at the risk of injury to her instincts, attain to greater consciousness, because in repudiating the mother she repudiates all that is obscure, instinctive, ambiguous, and unconscious in her own natureThanks to her lucidity, objectivity, and masculinity, a woman of this type is frequently found in important positions in which her tardily discovered maternal quality, guided by a cool intelligence, exerts a most beneficial influenceThis rare combination of womanliness and masculine understanding proves valuable in the realm of intimate relationships as well as in practical mattersAs the spiritual guide and adviser of a man, such a woman, unknown to the world, may play a highly influential partOwing to her qualities, the masculine mind finds this type easier to understand than women with other forms of mother-complex, and for this reason men often favour her with the projection of positive mother-complexesThe excessively feminine woman terrifies men who have a mother-complex characterized by great sensitivityBut this woman is not frightening to a man, because she builds bridges for the masculine mind over which he can safely guide his feelings to the opposite shoreHer clarity of understanding inspires him with confidence, a factor not to be underrated and one that is absent from the relationship between a man and a woman much more often than one might thinkThe man's Eros does not lead upward only but downward into that uncanny dark world of Hecate and Kali, which is a horror to any intellectual manThe understanding possessed by this type of woman will be a guiding star to him in the darkness and seemingly unending mazes of life.
From what has been said it should be clear that in the last analysis all the statements of mythology on this subject as well as the observed effects of the mother-complex, when stripped of their confusing detail, point to the unconscious as their place of originHow else could it have occurred to man to divide the cosmos, on the analogy of day and night, summer and winter, into a bright day-world and a dark night-world peopled with fabulous monsters, unless he had the prototype of such a division in himself, in the polarity between the conscious and the invisible and unknowable unconscious? Primitive man's perception of objects is conditioned only partly by the objective behaviour of the things themselves, whereas a much greater part is often played by intrapsychic facts which are not related to the external objects except by way of projectionThis is due to the simple fact that the primitive has not yet experienced that ascetic discipline of mind known to us as the critique of knowledgeTo him the world is a more or less fluid phenomenon within the stream of his own fantasy, where subject and object are undifferentiated and in a state of mutual interpenetrationAll that is outside, also is inside, we could say with GoetheBut this inside, which modern rationalism is so eager to derive from outside, has an a priori structure of its own that antedates all conscious experienceIt is quite impossible to conceive how experience in the widest sense, or, for that matter, anything psychic, could originate exclusively in the outside worldThe psyche is part of the inmost mystery of life, and it has its own peculiar structure and form like every other organismWhether this psychic structure and its elements, the archetypes, ever originated at all is a metaphysical question and therefore unanswerableThe structure is something given, the precondition that is found to be present in every caseAnd this is the mother, the matrix-the form into which all experience is pouredThe father, on the other hand, represents the dynamism of the archetype, for the archetype consists of both—form and energy.
The carrier of the archetype is in the first place the personal mother, because the child lives at first in complete participation with her, in a state of unconscious identityShe is the psychic as well as the physical precondition of the childWith the awakening of ego-consciousness the participation gradually weakens, and consciousness begins to enter into opposition to the unconscious, its own preconditionThis leads to differentiation of the ego from the mother, whose personal peculiarities gradually become more distinctAll the fabulous and mysterious qualities attaching to her image begin to fall away and are transferred to the person closest to her, for instance the grandmotherAs the mother of the mother, she is greater than the latter; she is in truth the grand or Great Mother. Not infrequently she assumes the attributes of wisdom as well as those of a witchFor the further the archetype recedes from consciousness and the clearer the latter becomes, the more distinctly does the archetype assume mythological featuresThe transition from mother to grandmother means that the archetype is elevated to a higher rankThis is clearly demonstrated in a notion held by the BataksThe funeral sacrifice in honour of a dead father is modest, consisting of ordinary foodBut if the son has a son of his own, then the father has become a grandfather and has consequently attained a more dignified status in the Beyond, and very important offerings are made to him.
As the distance between conscious and unconscious increases, the grandmother's more exalted rank transforms her into a Great Mother, and it frequently happens that the opposites contained in this image split apartWe then get a good fairy and a wicked fairy, or a benevolent goddess and one who is malevolent and dangerousIn Western antiquity and especially in Eastern cultures the opposites often remain united in the same figure, though this paradox does not disturb the primitive mind in the leastThe legends about the gods are as full of contradictions as are their moral charactersIn the West, the paradoxical behaviour and moral ambivalence of the gods scandalized people even in antiquity and gave rise to criticism that led finally to a devaluation of the Olympians on the one hand and to their philosophical interpretation on the otherThe clearest expression of this is the Christian reformation of the Jewish concept of the Deity: the morally ambiguous Yahweh became an exclusively good God, while everything evil was united in the devilIt seems as if the development of the feeling function in Western man forced a choice on him which led to the moral splitting of the divinity into two halvesIn the East the predominantly intuitive intellectual attitude left no room for feeling values, and the gods—Kali is a case in point—could retain their original paradoxical morality undisturbedThus Kali is representative of the East and the Madonna of the WestThe latter has entirely lost the shadow that still distantly followed her in the allegories of the Middle AgesIt was relegated to the hell of popular imagination, where it now leads an insignificant existence as the devil's grandmotherThanks to the development of feeling-values, the splendour of the light god has been enhanced beyond measure, but the darkness supposedly represented by the devil has localized itself in manThis strange development was precipitated chiefly by the fact that Christianity, terrified of Manichaean dualism, strove to preserve its monotheism by main forceBut since the reality of darkness and evil could not be denied, there was no alternative but to make man responsible for itEven the devil was largely, if not entirely, abolished, with the result that this metaphysical figure, who at one time was an integral part of the Deity, was introjected into man, who thereupon became the real carrier of the mysterium iniquitatis: omne bonum a Deo, omne malum ab homine. In recent times this development has suffered a diabolical reverse, and the wolf in sheep's clothing now goes about whispering in our ear that evil is really nothing but a misunderstanding of good and an effective instrument of progressWe think that the world of darkness has thus been abolished for good and all, and nobody realizes what a poisoning this is of man's soulIn this way he turns himself into the devil, for the devil is half of the archetype whose irresistible power makes even unbelievers ejaculate Oh God! on every suitable and unsuitable occasionIf one can possibly avoid it, one ought never to identify with an archetype, for, as psychopathology and certain contemporary events show, the consequences are terrifying.
Western man has sunk to such a low level spiritually that he even has to deny the apotheosis of untamed and untameable psychic power—the divinity itself—so that, after swallowing evil, he may possess himself of the good as wellIf you read Nietzsche's Zarathustra with attention and psychological understanding, you will see that he has described with rare consistency and with the passion of a truly religious person the psychology of the Superman for whom God is dead, and who is himself burst asunder because he tried to imprison the divine paradox within the narrow framework of the mortal manGoethe has wisely said: What terror then shall seize the Superman!—and was rewarded with a supercilious smile from the PhilistinesHis glorification of the Mother who is great enough to include in herself both the Queen of Heaven and Maria Aegyptiaca is supreme wisdom and profoundly significant for anyone willing to reflect upon itBut what can one expect in an age when the official spokesmen of Christianity publicly announce their in ability to understand the foundations of religious experience! I extract the following sentence from an article by a Protestant theologian: We understand ourselves—whether naturalistically or idealistically—to be homogeneous creatures who are not so peculiarly divided that alien forces can intervene in our inner life, as the New Testament supposes. (Italics mine.) The author is evidently unacquainted with the fact that science demonstrated the lability and dissociability of consciousness more than half a century ago and proved it by experimentOur conscious intentions are continually disturbed and thwarted, to a greater or lesser degree, by unconscious intrusions whose causes are at first strange to usThe psyche is far from being a homogeneous unit—on the contrary, it is a boiling cauldron of contradictory impulses, inhibitions, and affects, and for many people the conflict between them is so insupportable that they even wish for the deliverance preached by theologiansDeliverance from what? Obviously, from a highly questionable psychic stateThe unity of consciousness or of the so-called personality is not a reality at all but a desideratumI still have a vivid memory of a certain philosopher who also raved about this unity and used to consult me about his neurosis: he was obsessed by the idea that he was suffering from cancerI do not know how many specialists he had consulted already, and how many X-ray pictures he had had madeThey all assured him that he had no cancerHe himself told me: I know I have no cancer, but I still could have one. Who is responsible for this imaginary idea? He certainly did not make it himself; it was forced on him by an alien powerThere is little to choose between this state and that of the man possessed in the New TestamentNow whether you believe in a demon of the air or in a factor in the unconscious that plays diabolical tricks on you is all one to meThe fact that man's imagined unity is menaced by alien powers remains the same in either caseTheologians would do better to take account for once of these psychological facts than to go on demythologizing them with rationalistic explanations that are a hundred years behind the times.
I have tried in the foregoing to give a survey of the psychic phenomena that may be attributed to the predominance of the mother-imageAlthough I have not always drawn attention to them, my reader will presumably have had no difficulty in recognizing those features which characterize the Great Mother mythologically, even when they appear under the guise of personalistic psychologyWhen we ask patients who are particularly influenced by the mother-image to express in words or pictures what Mother means to them—be it positive or negative—we invariably get symbolical figures which must be regarded as direct analogies of the mythological mother-imageThese analogies take us into a field that still requires a great deal more work of elucidationAt any rate, I personally do not feel able to say anything definitive about itIf, nevertheless, I venture to offer a few suggestions, they should be regarded as altogether provisional and tentative.
Above all, I should like to point out that the mother-image in a man's psychology is entirely different in character from a woman'sFor a woman, the mother typifies her own conscious life as conditioned by her sexBut for a man the mother typifies something alien, which he has yet to experience and which is filled with the imagery latent in the unconsciousFor this reason, if for no other, the mother-image of a man is essentially different from a woman'sThe mother has from the outset a decidedly symbolical significance for a man, which probably accounts for his strong tendency to idealize herIdealization is a hidden apotropaism; one idealizes whenever there is a secret fear to be exorcizedWhat is feared is the unconscious and its magical influence.
Whereas for a man the mother is ipso facto symbolical, for a woman she becomes a symbol only in the course of her psychological developmentExperience reveals the striking fact that the Urania type of mother-image predominates in masculine psychology, whereas in a woman the chthonic type, or Earth Mother, is the most frequentDuring the manifest phase of the archetype an almost complete identification takes placeA woman can identify directly with the Earth Mother, but a man cannot (except in psychotic cases)As mythology shows, one of the peculiarities of the Great Mother is that she frequently appears paired with her male counterpartAccordingly the man identifies with the son-lover on whom the grace of Sophia has descended, with a puer aeternus or a filius sapientiaeBut the companion of the chthonic mother is the exact opposite: an ithyphallic Hermes (the Egyptian Bes) or a lingamIn India this symbol is of the highest spiritual significance, and in the West Hermes is one of the most contradictory figures of Hellenistic syncretism, which was the source of extremely important spiritual developments in Western civilizationHe is also the god of revelation, and in the unofficial nature philosophy of the early Middle Ages he is nothing less than the world-creating Nous itselfThis mystery has perhaps found its finest expression in the words of the Tabula smaragdina: omne superius sicut inferius (as it is above, so it is below).
It is a psychological fact that as soon as we touch on these identifications we enter the realm of the syzygies, the paired opposites, where the One is never separated from the Other, its antithesisIt is a field of personal experience which leads directly to the experience of individuation, the attainment of the selfA vast number of symbols for this process could be mustered from the medieval literature of the West and even more from the storehouses of Oriental wisdom, but in this matter words and ideas count for littleIndeed, they may become dangerous bypaths and false trailsIn this still very obscure field of psychological experience, where we are in direct contact, so to speak, with the archetype, its psychic power is felt in full forceThis realm is so entirely one of immediate experience that it cannot be captured by any formula, but can only be hinted at to one who already knowsHe will need no explanations to understand what was the tension of opposites expressed by Apuleius in his magnificent prayer to the Queen of Heaven, when he associates heavenly Venus with Proserpina, who strikest terror with midnight ululations: it was the terrifying paradox of the primordial mother-image.
When, in , I originally wrote this paper, I naturally did not know that twelve years later the Christian version of the mother archetype would be elevated to the rank of a dogmatic truthThe Christian Queen of Heaven has, obviously, shed all her Olympian qualities except for her brightness, goodness, and eternality; and even her human body, the thing most prone to gross material corruption, has put on an ethereal incorruptibilityThe richly varied allegories of the Mother of God have nevertheless retained some connection with her pagan prefigurations in Isis (Io) and SemeleNot only are Isis and the Horus-child iconological exemplars, but the ascension of Semele, the originally mortal mother of Dionysus, likewise anticipates the Assumption of the Blessed VirginFurther, this son of Semele is a dying and resurgent god and the youngest of the OlympiansSemele herself seems to have been an earth-goddess, just as the Virgin Mary is the earth from which Christ was bornThis being so, the question naturally arises for the psychologist: what has become of the characteristic relation of the mother-image to the earth, darkness, the abysmal side of the bodily man with his animal passions and instinctual nature, and to matter in general? The declaration of the dogma comes at a time when the achievements of science and technology, combined with a rationalistic and materialistic view of the world, threaten the spiritual and psychic heritage of man with instant annihilationHumanity is arming itself, in dread and fascinated horror, for a stupendous crimeCircumstances might easily arise when the hydrogen bomb would have to be used and the unthinkably frightful deed became unavoidable in legitimate self-defenceIn striking contrast to this disastrous turn of events, the Mother of God is now enthroned in heaven; indeed, her Assumption has actually been interpreted as a deliberate counterstroke to the materialistic doctrinairism that provoked the chthonic powers into revoltJust as Christ's appearance in his own day created a real devil and adversary of God out of what was originally a son of God dwelling in heaven, so now, conversely, a heavenly figure has split off from her original chthonic realm and taken up a counter-position to the titanic forces of the earth and the underworld that have been unleashedIn the same way that the Mother of God was divested of all the essential qualities of materiality, matter became completely de-souled, and this at a time when physics is pushing forward to insights which, if they do not exactly de-materialize matter, at least endue it with properties of its own and make its relation to the psyche a problem that can no longer be shelvedFor just as the tremendous advancement of science led at first to a premature dethronement of mind and to an equally ill-considered deification of matter, so it is this same urge for scientific knowledge that is now attempting to bridge the huge gulf that has opened out between the two WeltanschauungenThe psychologist inclines to see in the dogma of the Assumption a symbol which, in a sense, anticipates this whole developmentFor him the relationship to the earth and to matter is one of the inalienable qualities of the mother archetypeSo that when a figure that is conditioned by this archetype is represented as having been taken up into heaven, the realm of the spirit, this indicates a union of earth and heaven, or of matter and spiritThe approach of natural science will almost certainly be from the other direction: it will see in matter itself the equivalent of spirit, but this spirit will appear divested of all, or at any rate most, of its known qualities, just as earthly matter was stripped of its specific characteristics when it staged its entry into heavenNevertheless, the way will gradually be cleared for a union of the two principles.
Understood concretely, the Assumption is the absolute opposite of materialismTaken in this sense, it is a counterstroke that does nothing to diminish the tension between the opposites, but drives it to extremes.
Understood symbolically, however, the Assumption of the body is a recognition and acknowledgment of matter, which in the last resort was identified with evil only because of an overwhelmingly pneumatic tendency in manIn themselves, spirit and matter are neutral, or rather, utriusque capax—that is, capable of what man calls good or evilAlthough as names they are exceedingly relative, underlying them are very real opposites that are part of the energic structure of the physical and of the psychic world, and without them no existence of any kind could be establishedThere is no position without its negationIn spite or just because of their extreme opposition, neither can exist without the otherIt is exactly as formulated in classical Chinese philosophy: yang (the light, warm, dry, masculine principle) contains within it the seed of yin (the dark, cold, moist, feminine principle), and vice versaMatter therefore would contain the seed of spirit and spirit the seed of matterThe long-known synchronistic phenomena that have now been statistically confirmed by Rhine's experiments point, to all appearances, in this directionThe psychization of matter puts the absolute immateriality of spirit in question, since this would then have to be accorded a kind of substantialityThe dogma of the Assumption, proclaimed in an age suffering from the greatest political schism history has ever known, is a compensating symptom that reflects the strivings of science for a uniform world-pictureIn a certain sense, both developments were anticipated by alchemy in the hieros gamos of opposites, but only in symbolic formNevertheless, the symbol has the great advantage of being able to unite heterogeneous or even incommensurable factors in a single imageWith the decline of alchemy the symbolical unity of spirit and matter fell apart, with the result that modern man finds himself uprooted and alienated in a de-souled world.
The alchemist saw the union of opposites under the symbol of the tree, and it is therefore not surprising that the unconscious of present-day man, who no longer feels at home in his world and can base his existence neither on the past that is no more nor on the future that is yet to be, should hark back to the symbol of the cosmic tree rooted in this world and growing up to heaven—the tree that is also manIn the history of symbols this tree is described as the way of life itself, a growing into that which eternally is and does not change; which springs from the union of opposites and, by its eternal presence, also makes that union possibleIt seems as if it were only through an experience of symbolic reality that man, vainly seeking his own existence and making a philosophy out of it, can find his way back to a world in which he is no longer a stranger.
The concept of rebirth is not always used in the same senseSince this concept has various aspects, it may be useful to review its different meaningsThe five different forms which I am going to enumerate could probably be added to if one were to go into greater detail, but I venture to think that my definitions cover at least the cardinal meaningsIn the first part of my exposition, I give a brief summary of the different forms of rebirth, while the second part presents its various psychological aspectsIn the third part, I give an example of a rebirth mystery from the Koran.
MetempsychosisThe first of the five aspects of rebirth to which I should like to draw attention is that of metempsychosis, or transmigration of soulsAccording to this view, one's life is prolonged in time by passing through different bodily existences; or, from another point of view, it is a life-sequence interrupted by different reincarnationsEven in Buddhism, where this doctrine is of particular importance—the Buddha himself experienced a very long sequence of such rebirths—it is by no means certain whether continuity of personality is guaranteed or not: there may be only a continuity of karmaThe Buddha's disciples put this question to him during his lifetime, but he never made any definite statement as to whether there is or is not a continuity of personality.
ReincarnationThis concept of rebirth necessarily implies the continuity of personalityHere the human personality is regarded as continuous and accessible to memory, so that, when one is incarnated or born, one is able, at least potentially, to remember that one has lived through previous existences and that these existences were one's own, i.e., that they had the same ego-form as the present lifeAs a rule, reincarnation means rebirth in a human body.
ResurrectionThis means a re-establishment of human existence after deathA new element enters here: that of the change, transmutation, or transformation of one's beingThe change may be either essential, in the sense that the resurrected being is a different one; or nonessential, in the sense that only the general conditions of existence have changed, as when one finds oneself in a different place or in a body which is differently constitutedIt may be a carnal body, as in the Christian assumption that this body will be resurrectedOn a higher level, the process is no longer understood in a gross material sense; it is assumed that the resurrection of the dead is the raising up of the corpus glorificationis, the subtle body, in the state of incorruptibility.
Rebirth (renovatio)The fourth form concerns rebirth in the strict sense; that is to say, rebirth within the span of individual lifeThe English word rebirth is the exact equivalent of the German Wiedergeburt, but the French language seems to lack a term having the peculiar meaning of rebirth. This word has a special flavour; its whole atmosphere suggests the idea of renovatio, renewal, or even of improvement brought about by magical meansRebirth may be a renewal without any change of being, inasmuch as the personality which is renewed is not changed in its essential nature, but only its functions, or parts of the personality, are subjected to healing, strengthening, or improvementThus even bodily ills may be healed through rebirth ceremonies.
Another aspect of this fourth form is essential transformation, i.e., total rebirth of the individualHere the renewal implies a change of his essential nature, and may be called a transmutationAs examples we may mention the transformation of a mortal into an immortal being, of a corporeal into a spiritual being, and of a human into a divine beingWell-known prototypes of this change are the transfiguration and ascension of Christ, and the assumption of the Mother of God into heaven after her death, together with her bodySimilar conceptions are to be found in Part II of Goethe's Faust; for instance, the transformation of Faust into the boy and then into Doctor Marianus.
Participation in the process of transformationThe fifth and last form is indirect rebirthHere the transformation is brought about not directly, by passing through death and rebirth oneself, but indirectly, by participating in a process of transformation which is conceived of as taking place outside the individualIn other words, one has to witness, or take part in, some rite of transformationThis rite may be a ceremony such as the Mass, where there is a transformation of substancesThrough his presence at the rite the individual participates in divine graceSimilar transformations of the Deity are to be found in the pagan mysteries; there too the initiate sharing the experience is vouchsafed the gift of grace, as we know from the Eleusinian mysteriesA case in point is the confession of the initiate in the Eleusinian mysteries, who praises the grace conferred through the certainty of immortality.
Rebirth is not a process that we can in any way observeWe can neither measure nor weigh nor photograph itIt is entirely beyond sense perceptionWe have to do here with a purely psychic reality, which is transmitted to us only indirectly through personal statementsOne speaks of rebirth; one professes rebirth; one is filled with rebirthThis we accept as sufficiently realWe are not concerned here with the question: is rebirth a tangible process of some sort? We have to be content with its psychic realityI hasten to add that I am not alluding to the vulgar notion that anything psychic is either nothing at all or at best even more tenuous than a gasQuite the contrary; I am of the opinion that the psyche is the most tremendous fact of human lifeIndeed, it is the mother of all human facts; of civilization and of its destroyer, warAll this is at first psychic and invisibleSo long as it is merely psychic it cannot be experienced by the senses, but is nonetheless indisputably realThe mere fact that people talk about rebirth, and that there is such a concept at all, means that a store of psychic experiences designated by that term must actually existWhat these experiences are like we can only infer from the statements that have been made about themSo, if we want to find out what rebirth really is, we must turn to history in order to ascertain what rebirth has been understood to mean.
Rebirth is an affirmation that must be counted among the primordial affirmations of mankindThese primordial affirmations are based on what I call archetypesIn view of the fact that all affirmations relating to the sphere of the suprasensual are, in the last analysis, invariably determined by archetypes, it is not surprising that a concurrence of affirmations concerning rebirth can be found among the most widely differing peoplesThere must be psychic events underlying these affirmations which it is the business of psychology to discuss—without entering into all the metaphysical and philosophical assumptions regarding their significanceIn order to obtain a general view of their phenomenology, it is necessary to sketch the whole field of transformation experiences in sharper outlineTwo main groups of experience may be distinguished: that of the transcendence of life, and that of one's own transformation.
aExperiences induced by ritualBy the transcendence of life I mean those aforementioned experiences of the initiate who takes part in a sacred rite which reveals to him the perpetual continuation of life through transformation and renewalIn these mystery-dramas the transcendence of life, as distinct from its momentary concrete manifestations, is usually represented by the fateful transformations—death and rebirth—of a god or a godlike heroThe initiate may either be a mere witness of the divine drama or take part in it or be moved by it, or he may see himself identified through the ritual action with the godIn this case, what really matters is that an objective substance or form of life is ritually transformed through some process going on independently, while the initiate is influenced, impressed, consecrated, or granted divine grace on the mere ground of his presence or participationThe transformation process takes place not within him but outside him, although he may become involved in itThe initiate who ritually enacts the slaying, dismemberment, and scattering of Osiris, and afterwards his resurrection in the green wheat, experiences in this way the permanence and continuity of life, which outlasts all changes of form and, phoenix-like, continually rises anew from its own ashesThis participation in the ritual event gives rise, among other effects, to that hope of immortality which is characteristic of the Eleusinian mysteries.
A living example of the mystery drama representing the permanence as well as the transformation of life is the MassIf we observe the congregation during this sacred rite we note all degrees of participation, from mere indifferent attendance to the profoundest emotionThe groups of men standing about near the exit, who are obviously engaged in every sort of worldly conversation, crossing themselves and genuflecting in a purely mechanical way—even they, despite their inattention, participate in the sacral action by their mere presence in this place where grace aboundsThe Mass is an extramundane and extratemporal act in which Christ is sacrificed and then resurrected in the transformed substances; and this rite of his sacrificial death is not a repetition of the historical event but the original, unique, and eternal actThe experience of the Mass is therefore a participation in the transcendence of life, which overcomes all bounds of space and timeIt is a moment of eternity in time.
Immediate ExperiencesAll that the mystery drama represents and brings about in the spectator may also occur in the form of a spontaneous, ecstatic, or visionary experience, without any ritualNietzsche's Noontide Vision is a classic example of this kindNietzsche, as we know, substitutes for the Christian mystery the myth of Dionysus-Zagreus, who was dismembered and came to life againHis experience has the character of a Dionysian nature myth: the Deity appears in the garb of Nature, as classical antiquity saw it, and the moment of eternity is the noonday hour, sacred to Pan: Hath time flown away? Do I not fall? Have I not fallen—hark!—into the well of eternity? Even the golden ring, the ring of return, appears to him as a promise of resurrection and lifeIt is just as if Nietzsche had been present at a performance of the mysteries.
Many mystic experiences have a similar character: they represent an action in which the spectator becomes involved though his nature is not necessarily changedIn the same way, the most beautiful and impressive dreams often have no lasting or transformative effect on the dreamerHe may be impressed by them, but he does not necessarily see any problem in themThe event then naturally remains outside, like a ritual action performed by othersThese more aesthetic forms of experience must be carefully distinguished from those which indubitably involve a change of one's nature.
Transformations of personality are by no means rare occurrencesIndeed, they play a considerable role in psychopathology, although they are rather different from the mystical experiences just discussed, which are not easily accessible to psychological investigationHowever, the phenomena we are now about to examine belong to a sphere quite familiar to psychology.
Diminution of personalityAn example of the alteration of personality in the sense of diminution is furnished by what is known in primitive psychology as loss of soul. The peculiar condition covered by this term is accounted for in the mind of the primitive by the supposition that a soul has gone off, just like a dog that runs away from his master overnightIt is then the task of the medicine-man to fetch the fugitive backOften the loss occurs suddenly and manifests itself in a general malaiseThe phenomenon is closely connected with the nature of primitive consciousness, which lacks the firm coherence of our ownWe have control of our will power, but the primitive has notComplicated exercises are needed if he is to pull himself together for any activity that is conscious and intentional and not just emotional and instinctiveOur consciousness is safer and more dependable in this respect; but occasionally something similar can happen to civilized man, only he does not describe it as loss of soul but as an abaissement du niveau mental, Janet's apt term for this phenomenonIt is a slackening of the tensity of consciousness, which might be compared to a low barometric reading, presaging bad weatherThe tonus has given way, and this is felt subjectively as listlessness, moroseness, and depressionOne no longer has any wish or courage to face the tasks of the dayOne feels like lead, because no part of one's body seems willing to move, and this is due to the fact that one no longer has any disposable energyThis well-known phenomenon corresponds to the primitive's loss of soulThe listlessness and paralysis of will can go so far that the whole personality falls apart, so to speak, and consciousness loses its unity; the individual parts of the personality make themselves independent and thus escape from the control of the conscious mind, as in the case of anaesthetic areas or systematic amnesiasThe latter are well known as hysterical loss of function phenomenaThis medical term is analogous to the primitive loss of soul.
Abaissement du niveau mental can be the result of physical and mental fatigue, bodily illness, violent emotions, and shock, of which the last has a particularly deleterious effect on one's self-assuranceThe abaissement always has a restrictive influence on the personality as a wholeIt reduces one's self-confidence and the spirit of enterprise, and, as a result of increasing ego-centricity, narrows the mental horizonIn the end it may lead to the development of an essentially negative personality, which means that a falsification of the original personality has supervened.
bEnlargement of personalityThe personality is seldom, in the beginning, what it will be later onFor this reason the possibility of enlarging it exists, at least during the first half of lifeThe enlargement may be effected through an accretion from without, by new vital contents finding their way into the personality from outside and being assimilatedIn this way a considerable increase of personality may be experiencedWe therefore tend to assume that this increase comes only from without, thus justifying the prejudice that one becomes a personality by stuffing into oneself as much as possible from outsideBut the more assiduously we follow this recipe, and the more stubbornly we believe that all increase has to come from without, the greater becomes our inner povertyTherefore, if some great idea takes hold of us from outside, we must understand that it takes hold of us only because something in us responds to it and goes out to meet itRichness of mind consists in mental receptivity, not in the accumulation of possessionsWhat comes to us from outside, and, for that matter, everything that rises up from within, can only be made our own if we are capable of an inner amplitude equal to that of the incoming contentReal increase of personality means consciousness of an enlargement that flows from inner sourcesWithout psychic depth we can never be adequately related to the magnitude of our objectIt has therefore been said quite truly that a man grows with the greatness of his taskBut he must have within himself the capacity to grow; otherwise even the most difficult task is of no benefit to himMore likely he will be shattered by it.
A classic example of enlargement is Nietzsche's encounter with Zarathustra, which made of the critic and aphorist a tragic poet and prophetAnother example is StPaul, who, on his way to Damascus, was suddenly confronted by ChristTrue though it may be that this Christ of StPaul's would hardly have been possible without the historical Jesus, the apparition of Christ came to StPaul not from the historical Jesus but from the depths of his own unconscious.
When a summit of life is reached, when the bud unfolds and from the lesser the greater emerges, then, as Nietzsche says, One becomes Two, and the greater figure, which one always was but which remained invisible, appears to the lesser personality with the force of a revelationHe who is truly and hopelessly little will always drag the revelation of the greater down to the level of his littleness, and will never understand that the day of judgment for his littleness has dawnedBut the man who is inwardly great will know that the long expected friend of his soul, the immortal one, has now really come, to lead captivity captive; that is, to seize hold of him by whom this immortal had always been confined and held prisoner, and to make his life flow into that greater life—a moment of deadliest peril! Nietzsche's prophetic vision of the Tightrope Walker reveals the awful danger that lies in having a tightrope-walking attitude towards an event to which StPaul gave the most exalted name he could find.
Christ himself is the perfect symbol of the hidden immortal within the mortal manOrdinarily this problem is symbolized by a dual motif such as the Dioscuri, one of whom is mortal and the other immortalAn Indian parallel is the parable of the two friends:
Another notable parallel is the Islamic legend of the meeting of Moses and Khidr, to which I shall return later onNaturally the transformation of personality in this enlarging sense does not occur only in the form of such highly significant experiencesThere is no lack of more trivial instances, a list of which could easily be compiled from the clinical history of neurotic patientsIndeed, any case where the recognition of a greater personality seems to burst an iron ring round the heart must be included in this category.
Change of internal structureWe now come to changes of personality which imply neither enlargement nor diminution but a structural alterationOne of the most important forms is the phenomenon of possession: some content, an idea or a part of the personality, obtains mastery of the individual for one reason or anotherThe contents which thus take possession appear as peculiar convictions, idiosyncrasies, stubborn plans, and so forthAs a rule, they are not open to correctionOne has to be an especially good friend of the possessed person and willing to put up with almost anything if one is to attempt to deal with such a conditionI am not prepared to lay down any hard and fast line of demarcation between possession and paranoiaPossession can be formulated as identity of the ego-personality with a complex.
A common instance of this is identity with the persona, which is the individual's system of adaptation to, or the manner he assumes in dealing with, the worldEvery calling or profession, for example, has its own characteristic personaIt is easy to study these things nowadays, when the photographs of public personalities so frequently appear in the pressA certain kind of behaviour is forced on them by the world, and professional people endeavour to come up to these expectationsOnly, the danger is that they become identical with their personas—the professor with his text-book, the tenor with his voiceThen the damage is done; henceforth he lives exclusively against the background of his own biographyFor by that time it is written: … then he went to such and such a place and said this or that, etcThe garment of Deianeira has grown fast to his skin, and a desperate decision like that of Heracles is needed if he is to tear this Nessus shirt from his body and step into the consuming fire of the flame of immortality, in order to transform himself into what he really isOne could say, with a little exaggeration, that the persona is that which in reality one is not, but which oneself as well as others think one isIn any case the temptation to be what one seems to be is great, because the persona is usually rewarded in cash.
There are still other factors which may take possession of the individual, one of the most important being the so-called inferior function. This is not the place to enter into a detailed discussion of this problem; I should only like to point out that the inferior function is practically identical with the dark side of the human personalityThe darkness which clings to every personality is the door into the unconscious and the gateway of dreams, from which those two twilight figures, the shadow and the anima, step into our nightly visions or, remaining invisible, take possession of our ego-consciousnessA man who is possessed by his shadow is always standing in his own light and falling into his own trapsWhenever possible, he prefers to make an unfavourable impression on othersIn the long run luck is always against him, because he is living below his own level and at best only attains what does not suit himAnd if there is no doorstep for him to stumble over, he manufactures one for himself and then fondly believes he has done something useful.
Possession caused by the anima or animus presents a different pictureAbove all, this transformation of personality gives prominence to those traits which are characteristic of the opposite sex; in man the feminine traits, and in woman the masculineIn the state of possession both figures lose their charm and their values; they retain them only when they are turned away from the world, in the introverted state, when they serve as bridges to the unconsciousTurned towards the world, the anima is fickle, capricious, moody, uncontrolled and emotional, sometimes gifted with daemonic intuitions, ruthless, malicious, untruthful, bitchy, double-faced, and mysticalThe animus is obstinate, harping on principles, laying down the law, dogmatic, world-reforming, theoretic, word-mongering, argumentative, and domineeringBoth alike have bad taste: the anima surrounds herself with inferior people, and the animus lets himself be taken in by second-rate thinking.
Another form of structural change concerns certain unusual observations about which I speak only with the utmost reserveI refer to states of possession in which the possession is caused by something that could perhaps most fitly be described as an ancestral soul, by which I mean the soul of some definite forebearFor all practical purposes, such cases may be regarded as striking instances of identification with deceased persons(Naturally, the phenomena of identity only occur after the ancestor's death.) My attention was first drawn to such possibilities by Léon Daudet's confused but ingenious book L'HérédoDaudet supposes that, in the structure of the personality, there are ancestral elements which under certain conditions may suddenly come to the foreThe individual is then precipitately thrust into an ancestral roleNow we know that ancestral roles play a very important part in primitive psychologyNot only are ancestral spirits supposed to be reincarnated in children, but an attempt is made to implant them into the child by naming him after an ancestorSo, too, primitives try to change themselves back into their ancestors by means of certain ritesI would mention especially the Australian conception of the alcheringamijina, ancestral souls, half man and half animal, whose reactivation through religious rites is of the greatest functional significance for the life of the tribeIdeas of this sort, dating back to the Stone Age, were widely diffused, as may be seen from numerous other traces that can be found elsewhereIt is therefore not improbable that these primordial forms of experience may recur even today as cases of identification with ancestral souls, and I believe I have seen such cases.
dIdentification with a groupWe shall now discuss another form of transformation experience which I would call identification with a groupMore accurately speaking, it is the identification of an individual with a number of people who, as a group, have a collective experience of transformationThis special psychological situation must not be confused with participation in a transformation rite, which, though performed before an audience, does not in any way depend upon group identity or necessarily give rise to itTo experience transformation in a group and to experience it in oneself are two totally different thingsIf any considerable group of persons are united and identified with one another by a particular frame of mind, the resultant transformation experience bears only a very remote resemblance to the experience of individual transformationA group experience takes place on a lower level of consciousness than the experience of an individualThis is due to the fact that, when many people gather together to share one common emotion, the total psyche emerging from the group is below the level of the individual psycheIf it is a very large group, the collective psyche will be more like the psyche of an animal, which is the reason why the ethical attitude of large organizations is always doubtfulThe psychology of a large crowd inevitably sinks to the level of mob psychologyIf, therefore, I have a so-called collective experience as a member of a group, it takes place on a lower level of consciousness than if I had the experience by myself aloneThat is why this group experience is very much more frequent than an individual experience of transformationIt is also much easier to achieve, because the presence of so many people together exerts great suggestive forceThe individual in a crowd easily becomes the victim of his own suggestibilityIt is only necessary for something to happen, for instance a proposal backed by the whole crowd, and we too are all for it, even if the proposal is immoralIn the crowd one feels no responsibility, but also no fear.
Thus identification with the group is a simple and easy path to follow, but the group experience goes no deeper than the level of one's own mind in that stateIt does work a change in you, but the change does not lastOn the contrary, you must have continual recourse to mass intoxication in order to consolidate the experience and your belief in itBut as soon as you are removed from the crowd, you are a different person again and unable to reproduce the previous state of mindThe mass is swayed by participation mystique, which is nothing other than an unconscious identitySupposing, for example, you go to the theatre: glance meets glance, everybody observes everybody else, so that all those who are present are caught up in an invisible web of mutual unconscious relationshipIf this condition increases, one literally feels borne along by the universal wave of identity with othersIt may be a pleasant feeling—one sheep among ten thousand! Again, if I feel that this crowd is a great and wonderful unity, I am a hero, exalted along with the groupWhen I am myself again, I discover that I am MrSo-and-So, and that I live in such and such a street, on the third floorI also find that the whole affair was really most delightful, and I hope it will take place again tomorrow so that I may once more feel myself to be a whole nation, which is much better than being just plain MrXSince this is such an easy and convenient way of raising one's personality to a more exalted rank, mankind has always formed groups which made collective experiences of transformation—often of an ecstatic nature—possibleThe regressive identification with lower and more primitive states of consciousness is invariably accompanied by a heightened sense of life; hence the quickening effect of regressive identifications with half-animal ancestors in the Stone Age.
The inevitable psychological regression within the group is partially counteracted by ritual, that is to say through a cult ceremony which makes the solemn performance of sacred events the centre of group activity and prevents the crowd from relapsing into unconscious instinctualityBy engaging the individual's interest and attention, the ritual makes it possible for him to have a comparatively individual experience even within the group and so to remain more or less consciousBut if there is no relation to a centre which expresses the unconscious through its symbolism, the mass psyche inevitably becomes the hypnotic focus of fascination, drawing everyone under its spellThat is why masses are always breeding-grounds of psychic epidemics, the events in Germany being a classic example of this.
It will be objected to this essentially negative evaluation of mass psychology that there are also positive experiences, for instance a positive enthusiasm which spurs the individual to noble deeds, or an equally positive feeling of human solidarityFacts of this kind should not be deniedThe group can give the individual a courage, a bearing, and a dignity which may easily get lost in isolationIt can awaken within him the memory of being a man among menBut that does not prevent something else from being added which he would not possess as an individualSuch unearned gifts may seem a special favour of the moment, but in the long run there is a danger of the gift becoming a loss, since human nature has a weak habit of taking gifts for granted; in times of necessity we demand them as a right instead of making the effort to obtain them ourselvesOne sees this, unfortunately, only too plainly in the tendency to demand everything from the State, without reflecting that the State consists of those very individuals who make the demandsThe logical development of this tendency leads to Communism, where each individual enslaves the community and the latter is represented by a dictator, the slave-ownerAll primitive tribes characterized by a communistic order of society also have a chieftain over them with unlimited powersThe Communist State is nothing other than an absolute monarchy in which there are no subjects, but only serfs.
Identification with a cult-heroAnother important identification underlying the transformation experience is that with the god or hero who is transformed in the sacred ritualMany cult ceremonies are expressly intended to bring this identity about, an obvious example being the Metamorphosis of ApuleiusThe initiate, an ordinary human being, is elected to be Helios; he is crowned with a crown of palms and clad in the mystic mantle, whereupon the assembled crowd pays homage to himThe suggestion of the crowd brings about his identity with the godThe participation of the community can also take place in the following way: there is no apotheosis of the initiate, but the sacred action is recited, and then, in the course of long periods of time, psychic changes gradually occur in the individual participantsThe Osiris cult offers an excellent example of thisAt first only Pharaoh participated in the transformation of the god, since he alone had an Osiris; but later the nobles of the Empire acquired an Osiris too, and finally this development culminated in the Christian idea that everyone has an immortal soul and shares directly in the GodheadIn Christianity the development was carried still further when the outer God or Christ gradually became the inner Christ of the individual believer, remaining one and the same though dwelling in manyThis truth had already been anticipated by the psychology of totemism: many exemplars of the totem animal are killed and consumed during the totem meals, and yet it is only the One who is being eaten, just as there is only one Christ-child and one Santa Claus.
In the mysteries, the individual undergoes an indirect transformation through his participation in the fate of the godThe transformation experience is also an indirect one in the Christian Church, inasmuch as it is brought about by participation in something acted or recitedHere the first form, the dromenon, is characteristic of the richly developed ritual of the Catholic Church; the second form, the recitation, the Word or gospel, is practised in the preaching of the Word in Protestantism.
Magical proceduresA further form of transformation is achieved through a rite used directly for this purposeInstead of the transformation experience coming to one through participation in the rite, the rite is used for the express purpose of effecting the transformationIt thus becomes a sort of technique to which one submits oneselfFor instance, a man is ill and consequently needs to be renewed. The renewal must happen to him from outside, and to bring this about, he is pulled through a hole in the wall at the head of his sick-bed, and now he is reborn; or he is given another name and thereby another soul, and then the demons no longer recognize him; or he has to pass through a symbolical death; or, grotesquely enough, he is pulled through a leathern cow, which devours him, so to speak, in front and then expels him behind; or he undergoes an ablution or baptismal bath and miraculously changes into a semi-divine being with a new character and an altered metaphysical destiny.
Technical transformationBesides the use of the rite in the magical sense, there are still other special techniques in which, in addition to the grace inherent in the rite, the personal endeavour of the initiate is needed in order to achieve the intended purposeIt is a transformation experience induced by technical meansThe exercises known in the East as yoga and in the West as exercitia spiritualia come into this categoryThese exercises represent special techniques prescribed in advance and intended to achieve a definite psychic effect, or at least to promote itThis is true both of Eastern yoga and of the methods practised in the WestThey are, therefore, technical procedures in the fullest sense of the word; elaborations of the originally natural processes of transformationThe natural or spontaneous transformations that occurred earlier, before there were any historical examples to follow, were thus replaced by techniques designed to induce the transformation by imitating this same sequence of eventsI will try to give an idea of the way such techniques may have originated by relating a fairy story:
There was once a queer old man who lived in a cave, where he had sought refuge from the noise of the villagesHe was reputed to be a sorcerer, and therefore he had disciples who hoped to learn the art of sorcery from himBut he himself was not thinking of any such thingHe was only seeking to know what it was that he did not know, but which, he felt certain, was always happeningAfter meditating for a very long time on that which is beyond meditation, he saw no other way of escape from his predicament than to take a piece of red chalk and draw all kinds of diagrams on the walls of his cave, in order to find out what that which he did not know might look likeAfter many attempts he hit on the circleThat's right, he felt, and now for a quadrangle inside it!—which made it better stillHis disciples were curious; but all they could make out was that the old man was up to something, and they would have given anything to know what he was doingBut when they asked him: What are you doing there? he made no replyThen they discovered the diagrams on the wall and said: That's it!—and they all imitated the diagramsBut in so doing they turned the whole process upside down, without noticing it: they anticipated the result in the hope of making the process repeat itself which had led to that resultThis is how it happened then and how it still happens today.
As I have pointed out, in addition to the technical processes of transformation there are also natural transformationsAll ideas of rebirth are founded on this factNature herself demands a death and a rebirthAs the alchemist Democritus says: Nature rejoices in nature, nature subdues nature, nature rules over nature. There are natural transformation processes which simply happen to us, whether we like it or not, and whether we know it or notThese processes develop considerable psychic effects, which would be sufficient in themselves to make any thoughtful person ask himself what really happened to himLike the old man in our fairytale, he, too, will draw mandalas and seek shelter in their protective circle; in the perplexity and anguish of his self-chosen prison, which he had deemed a refuge, he is transformed into a being akin to the godsMandalas are birth-places, vessels of birth in the most literal sense, lotus-flowers in which a Buddha comes to lifeSitting in the lotus-seat, the yogi sees himself transfigured into an immortal.
Natural transformation processes announce themselves mainly in dreamsElsewhere I have presented a series of dream-symbols of the process of individuationThey were dreams which without exception exhibited rebirth symbolismIn this particular case there was a long-drawn-out process of inner transformation and rebirth into another beingThis other being is the other person in ourselves—that larger and greater personality maturing within us, whom we have already met as the inner friend of the soulThat is why we take comfort whenever we find the friend and companion depicted in a ritual, an example being the friendship between Mithras and the sun-godThis relationship is a mystery to the scientific intellect, because the intellect is accustomed to regard these things unsympatheticallyBut if it made allowance for feeling, we would discover that it is the friend whom the sun-god takes with him on his chariot, as shown in the monumentsIt is the representation of a friendship between two men which is simply the outer reflection of an inner fact: it reveals our relationship to that inner friend of the soul into whom Nature herself would like to change us—that other person who we also are and yet can never attain to completelyWe are that pair of Dioscuri, one of whom is mortal and the other immortal, and who, though always together, can never be made completely oneThe transformation processes strive to approximate them to one another, but our consciousness is aware of resistances, because the other person seems strange and uncanny, and because we cannot get accustomed to the idea that we are not absolute master in our own houseWe should prefer to be always I and nothing elseBut we are confronted with that inner friend or foe, and whether he is our friend or our foe depends on ourselves.
You need not be insane to hear his voiceOn the contrary, it is the simplest and most natural thing imaginableFor instance, you can ask yourself a question to which he gives answerThe discussion is then carried on as in any other conversationYou can describe it as mere associating or talking to oneself, or as a meditation in the sense used by the old alchemists, who referred to their interlocutor as aliquem alium internum, a certain other one, within.' This form of colloquy with the friend of the soul was even admitted by Ignatius Loyola into the technique of his Exercitia spiritualia, but with the limiting condition that only the person meditating is allowed to speak, whereas the inner responses are passed over as being merely human and therefore to be repudiatedThis state of things has continued down to the present dayIt is no longer a moral or metaphysical prejudice, but—what is much worse—an intellectual oneThe voice is explained as nothing but associating, pursued in a witless way and running on and on without sense or purpose, like the works of a clock that has no dialOr we say It is only my own thoughts! even if, on closer inspection, it should turn out that they are thoughts which we either reject or had never consciously thought at all—as if everything psychic that is glimpsed by the ego had always formed part of it! Naturally this hybris serves the useful purpose of maintaining the supremacy of ego-consciousness, which must be safeguarded against dissolution into the unconsciousBut it breaks down ignominiously if ever the unconscious should choose to let some nonsensical idea become an obsession or to produce other psychogenic symptoms, for which we would not like to accept responsibility on any account.
Our attitude towards this inner voice alternates between two extremes: it is regarded either as undiluted nonsense or as the voice of GodIt does not seem to occur to any one that there might be something valuable in betweenThe other may be just as one-sided in one way as the ego is in anotherAnd yet the conflict between them may give rise to truth and meaning—but only if the ego is willing to grant the other its rightful personalityIt has, of course, a personality anyway, just as have the voices of insane people; but a real colloquy becomes possible only when the ego acknowledges the existence of a partner to the discussionThis cannot be expected of everyone, because, after all, not everyone is a fit subject for exercitia spiritualiaNor can it be called a colloquy if one speaks only to oneself or only addresses the other, as is the case with George Sand in her conversations with a spiritual friend:a for thirty pages she talks exclusively to herself while one waits in vain for the other to replyThe colloquy of the exercitia may be followed by that silent grace in which the modern doubter no longer believesBut what if it were the supplicated Christ himself who gave immediate answer in the words of the sinful human heart? What fearful abysses of doubt would then be opened? What madness should we not then have to fear? From this one can understand that images of the gods are better mute, and that ego-consciousness had better believe in its own supremacy rather than go on associating. One can also understand why that inner friend so often seems to be our enemy, and why he is so far off and his voice so lowFor he who is near to him is near to the fire.
Something of this sort may have been in the mind of the alchemist who wrote: Choose for your Stone him through whom kings are honoured in their crowns, and through whom physicians heal their sick, for he is near to the fire. The alchemists projected the inner event into an outer figure, so for them the inner friend appeared in the form of the Stone, of which the Tractatus aureus says: Understand, ye sons of the wise, what this exceeding precious Stone crieth out to you: Protect me and I will protect theeGive me what is mine that I may help thee. To this a scholiast adds: The seeker after truth hears both the Stone and the Philosopher speaking as if out of one mouth. The Philosopher is Hermes, and the Stone is identical with Mercurius, the Latin HermesFrom the earliest times, Hermes was the mystagogue and psychopomp of the alchemists, their friend and counsellor, who leads them to the goal of their workHe is like a teacher mediating between the stone and the disciple. To others the friend appears in the shape of Christ or Khidr or a visible or invisible guru, or some other personal guide or leader figureIn this case the colloquy is distinctly one-sided: there is no inner dialogue, but instead the response appears as the action of the other, i.e., as an outward eventThe alchemists saw it in the transformation of the chemical substanceSo if one of them sought transformation, he discovered it outside in matter, whose transformation cried out to him, as it were, I am the transformation! But some were clever enough to know, It is my own transformation—not a personal transformation, but the transformation of what is mortal in me into what is immortalIt shakes off the mortal husk that I am and awakens to a life of its own; it mounts the sun-barge and may take me with it.
This is a very ancient ideaIn Upper Egypt, near Aswan, I once saw an ancient Egyptian tomb that had just been openedJust behind the entrance-door was a little basket made of reeds, containing the withered body of a new-born infant, wrapped in ragsEvidently the wife of one of the workmen had hastily laid the body of her dead child in the nobleman's tomb at the last moment, hoping that, when he entered the sun-barge in order to rise anew, it might share in his salvation, because it had been buried in the holy precinct within reach of divine grace.
I have chosen as an example a figure which plays a great role in Islamic mysticism, namely Khidr, the Verdant One. He appears in the Eighteenth Sura of the Koran, entitled The Cave. This entire Sura is taken up with a rebirth mysteryThe cave is the place of rebirth, that secret cavity in which one is shut up in order to be incubated and renewedThe Koran says of it: You might have seen the rising sun decline to the right of their cavern, and as it set, go past them on the left, while they the Seven Sleepers stayed in the middle. The middle is the centre where the jewel reposes, where the incubation or the sacrificial rite or the transformation takes placeThe most beautiful development of this symbolism is to be found on Mithraic altarpieces and in alchemical pictures of the transformative substance, which is always shown between sun and moonRepresentations of the crucifixion frequently follow the same type, and a similar symbolical arrangement is also found in the transformation or healing ceremonies of the NavahosJust such a place of the centre or of transformation is the cave in which those seven had gone to sleep, little thinking that they would experience there a prolongation of life verging on immortalityWhen they awoke, they had slept  years.
The legend has the following meaning: Anyone who gets into that cave, that is to say into the cave which everyone has in himself, or into the darkness that lies behind consciousness, will find himself involved in an—at first—unconscious process of transformationBy penetrating into the unconscious he makes a connection with his unconscious contentsThis may result in a momentous change of personality in the positive or negative senseThe transformation is often interpreted as a prolongation of the natural span of life or as an earnest of immortalityThe former is the case with many alchemists, notably Paracelsus (in his treatise De vita longa), and the latter is exemplified in the Eleusinian mysteries.
Those seven sleepers indicate by their sacred number that they are gods, who are transformed during sleep and thereby enjoy eternal youthThis helps us to understand at the outset that we are dealing with a mystery legendThe fate of the numinous figures recorded in it grips the hearer, because the story gives expression to parallel processes in his own unconscious which in that way are integrated with consciousness againThe repristination of the original state is tantamount to attaining once more the freshness of youth.
The story of the sleepers is followed by some moral observations which appear to have no connection with itBut this apparent irrelevance is deceptiveIn reality, these edifying comments are just what are needed by those who cannot be reborn themselves and have to be content with moral conduct, that is to say with adherence to the lawVery often behaviour prescribed by rule is a substitute for spiritual transformationThese edifying observations are then followed by the story of Moses and his servant Joshua ben Nun:
And Moses said to his servant: I will not cease from my wanderings until I have reached the place where the two seas meet, even though I journey for eighty years.
But when they had reached the place where the two seas meet, they forgot their fish, and it took its way through a stream to the sea.
And when they had journeyed past this place, Moses said to his servant: Bring us our breakfast, for we are weary from this journey.
But the other replied: See what has befallen me! When we were resting there by the rock, I forgot the fishOnly Satan can have put it out of my mind, and in wondrous fashion it took its way to the sea.
Then Moses said: That is the place we seek. And they went back the way they had comeAnd they found one of Our servants, whom We had endowed with Our grace and Our wisdomMoses said to him: Shall I follow you, that you may teach me for my guidance some of the wisdom you have learnt?
But he answered: You will not bear with me, for how should you bear patiently with things you cannot comprehend?
Moses said: If Allah wills, you shall find me patient; I shall not in anything disobey you.
He said: If you are bent on following me, you must ask no question about anything till I myself speak to you concerning it.
The two set forth, but as soon as they embarked, Moses' companion bored a hole in the bottom of the ship.
A strange thing you have done! exclaimed MosesIs it to drown her passengers that you have bored a hole in her?
Did I not tell you, he replied, that you would not bear with me?
Pardon my forgetfulness, said MosesDo not be angry with me on this account.
They journeyed on until they fell in with a certain youthMoses' companion slew him, and Moses said: You have killed an innocent man who has done no harmSurely you have committed a wicked crime.
Did I not tell you, he replied, that you would not bear with me?
Moses said: If ever I question you again, abandon me; for then I should deserve it.
They travelled on until they came to a certain cityThey asked the people for some food, but the people declined to receive them as their guestsThere they found a wall on the point of falling downThe other raised it up, and Moses said: Had you wished, you could have demanded payment for your labours.
Now the time has arrived when we must part, said the otherBut first I will explain to you those acts of mine which you could not bear with in patience.
Know that the ship belonged to some poor fishermenI damaged it because in their rear was a king who was taking every ship by force.
As for the youth, his parents both are true believers, and we feared lest he should plague them with his wickedness and unbeliefIt was our wish that their Lord should grant them another in his place, a son more righteous and more filial.
As for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city whose father was an honest manBeneath it their treasure is buriedYour Lord decreed in His mercy that they should dig out their treasure when they grew to manhoodWhat I did was not done by capriceThat is the meaning of the things you could not bear with in patience.
This story is an amplification and elucidation of the legend of the seven sleepers and the problem of rebirthMoses is the man who seeks, the man on the quest. On this pilgrimage he is accompanied by his shadow, the servant or lower man (pneumatikos and sarkikos in two individuals)Joshua is the son of Nun, which is a name for fish, suggesting that Joshua had his origin in the depths of the waters, in the darkness of the shadow-worldThe critical place is reached where the two seas meet, which is interpreted as the isthmus of Suez, where the Western and the Eastern seas come close togetherIn other words, it is that place of the middle which we have already met in the symbolic preamble, but whose significance was not recognized at first by the man and his shadowThey had forgotten their fish, the humble source of nourishmentThe fish refers to Nun, the father of the shadow, of the carnal man, who comes from the dark world of the CreatorFor the fish came alive again and leapt out of the basket in order to find its way back to its homeland, the seaIn other words, the animal ancestor and creator of life separates himself from the conscious man, an event which amounts to loss of the instinctive psycheThis process is a symptom of dissociation well known in the psychopathology of the neuroses; it is always connected with one-sidedness of the conscious attitudeIn view of the fact, however, that neurotic phenomena are nothing but exaggerations of normal processes, it is not to be wondered at that very similar phenomena can also be found within the scope of the normalIt is a question of that well-known loss of soul among primitives, as described above in the section on diminution of the personality; in scientific language, an abaissement du niveau mental.
Moses and his servant soon notice what has happenedMoses had sat down, worn out and hungryEvidently he had a feeling of insufficiency, for which a physiological explanation is givenFatigue is one of the most regular symptoms of loss of energy or libidoThe entire process represents something very typical, namely the failure to recognize a moment of crucial importance, a motif which we encounter in a great variety of mythical formsMoses realizes that he has unconsciously found the source of life and then lost it again, which we might well regard as a remarkable intuitionThe fish they had intended to eat is a content of the unconscious, by which the connection with the origin is re-establishedHe is the reborn one, who has awakened to new lifeThis came to pass, as the commentaries say, through the contact with the water of life: by slipping back into the sea, the fish once more becomes a content of the unconscious, and its offspring are distinguished by having only one eye and half a head.
The alchemists, too, speak of a strange fish in the sea, the round fish lacking bones and skin, which symbolizes the round element, the germ of the animate stone, of the filius philosophorumThe water of life has its parallel in the aqua permanens of alchemyThis water is extolled as vivifying, besides which it has the property of dissolving all solids and coagulating all liquidsThe Koran commentaries state that, on the spot where the fish disappeared, the sea was turned to solid ground, whereon the tracks of the fish could still be seenOn the island thus formed Khidr was sitting, in the place of the middleA mystical interpretation says that he was sitting on a throne consisting of light, between the upper and the lower sea, again in the middle positionThe appearance of Khidr seems to be mysteriously connected with the disappearance of the fishIt looks almost as if he himself had been the fishThis conjecture is supported by the fact that the commentaries relegate the source of life to the place of darkness. The depths of the sea are dark (mare tenebrositatis)The darkness has its parallel in the alchemical nigredo, which occurs after the coniunctio, when the female takes the male into herselfFrom the nigredo issues the Stone, the symbol of the immortal self; moreover, its first appearance is likened to fish eyes.
Khidr may well be a symbol of the selfHis qualities signalize him as such: he is said to have been born in a cave, i.e., in darknessHe is the Long-lived One, who continually renews himself, like ElijahLike Osiris, he is dismembered at the end of time, by Antichrist, but is able to restore himself to lifeHe is analogous to the Second Adam, with whom the reanimated fish is identified; he is a counsellor, a Paraclete, Brother Khidr. Anyway Moses accepts him as a higher consciousness and looks up to him for instructionThen follow those incomprehensible deeds which show how ego-consciousness reacts to the superior guidance of the self through the twists and turns of fateTo the initiate who is capable of transformation it is a comforting tale; to the obedient believer, an exhortation not to murmur against Allah's incomprehensible omnipotenceKhidr symbolizes not only the higher wisdom but also a way of acting which is in accord with this wisdom and transcends reason.
Anyone hearing such a mystery tale will recognize himself in the questing Moses and the forgetful Joshua, and the tale shows him how the immortality-bringing rebirth comes aboutCharacteristically, it is neither Moses nor Joshua who is transformed, but the forgotten fishWhere the fish disappears, there is the birthplace of KhidrThe immortal being issues from something humble and forgotten, indeed, from a wholly improbable sourceThis is the familiar motif of the hero's birth and need not be documented hereAnyone who knows the Bible will think of Isaiah :ff., where the servant of God is described, and of the gospel stories of the NativityThe nourishing character of the transformative substance or deity is borne out by numerous cult-legends: Christ is the bread, Osiris the wheat, Mondamin the maize, etcThese symbols coincide with a psychic fact which obviously, from the point of view of consciousness, has the significance merely of something to be assimilated, but whose real nature is overlookedThe fish symbol shows immediately what this is: it is the nourishing influence of unconscious contents, which maintain the vitality of consciousness by a continual influx of energy; for consciousness does not produce its energy by itselfWhat is capable of transformation is just this root of consciousness, which—inconspicuous and almost invisible (i.e., unconscious) though it is—provides consciousness with all its energySince the unconscious gives us the feeling that it is something alien, a non-ego, it is quite natural that it should be symbolized by an alien figureThus, on the one hand, it is the most insignificant of things, while on the other, so far as it potentially contains that round wholeness which consciousness lacks, it is the most significant of allThis round thing is the great treasure that lies hidden in the cave of the unconscious, and its personification is this personal being who represents the higher unity of conscious and unconsciousIt is a figure comparable to Hiranyagarbha, Purusha, Atman, and the mystic BuddhaFor this reason I have elected to call it the self, by which I understand a psychic totality and at the same time a centre, neither of which coincides with the ego but includes it, just as a larger circle encloses a smaller one.
The intuition of immortality which makes itself felt during the transformation is connected with the peculiar nature of the unconsciousIt is, in a sense, non-spatial and non-temporalThe empirical proof of this is the occurrence of so-called telepathic phenomena, which are still denied by hypersceptical critics, although in reality they are much more common than is generally supposedThe feeling of immortality, it seems to me, has its origin in a peculiar feeling of extension in space and time, and I am inclined to regard the deification rites in the mysteries as a projection of this same psychic phenomenon.
The character of the self as a personality comes out very plainly in the Khidr legendThis feature is most strikingly expressed in the non-Koranic stories about Khidr, of which Vollers gives some telling examplesDuring my trip through Kenya, the headman of our safari was a Somali who had been brought up in the Sufi faithTo him Khidr was in every way a living person, and he assured me that I might at any time meet Khidr, because I was, as he put it, a M'tu-ya-kitabu, a man of the Book,' meaning the KoranHe had gathered from our talks that I knew the Koran better than he did himself (which was, by the way, not saying a great deal)For this reason he regarded me as islamu. He told me I might meet Khidr in the street in the shape of a man, or he might appear to me during the night as a pure white light, or—he smilingly picked a blade of grass—the Verdant One might even look like thatHe said he himself had once been comforted and helped by Khidr, when he could not find a job after the war and was suffering wantOne night, while he slept, he dreamt he saw a bright white light near the door and he knew it was KhidrQuickly leaping to his feet (in the dream), he reverentially saluted him with the words salem aleikum, peace be with you,' and then he knew that his wish would be fulfilledHe added that a few days later he was offered the post as headman of a safari by a firm of outfitters in Nairobi.
This shows that, even in our own day, Khidr still lives on in the religion of the people, as friend, adviser, comforter, and teacher of revealed wisdomThe position assigned to him by dogma was, according to my Somali, that of maleika kwanza-ya-mungu, First Angel of God'—a sort of Angel of the Face, an angelos in the true sense of the word, a messenger.
Khidr's character as a friend explains the subsequent part of the Eighteenth Sura, which reads as follows:
They will ask you about DhulqarneinSay: I will give you an account of him.
We made him mighty in the land and gave him means to achieve all thingsHe journeyed on a certain road until he reached the West and saw the sun setting in a pool of black mudHard by he found a certain people.
Dhulqarnein,' We said, you must either punish them or show them kindness.'
He replied: The wicked We shall surely punishThen they shall return to their Lord and be sternly punished by HimAs for those that have faith and do good works, we shall bestow on them a rich reward and deal indulgently with them.'
He then journeyed along another road until he reached the East and saw the sun rising upon a people whom We had utterly exposed to its flaming raysSo he did; and We had full knowledge of all the forces at his command.
Then he followed yet another route until he came between the Two Mountains and found a people who could barely understand a wordDhulqarnein,' they said, Gog and Magog are ravaging this landBuild us a rampart against them and we will pay you tribute.'
He replied: The power which my Lord has given me is better than any tributeLend me a force of labourers, and I will raise a rampart between you and themCome, bring me blocks of iron.'
He dammed up the valley between the Two Mountains, and said: Ply your bellows.' And when the iron blocks were red with heat, he said: Bring me molten brass to pour on them.'
Gog and Magog could not scale it, nor could they dig their way through itHe said: This is a blessing from my LordBut when my Lord's promise is fulfilled, He will level it to dustThe promise of my Lord is true.'
On that day We will let them come in tumultuous throngsThe Trumpet shall be sounded and We will gather them all together.
On that day Hell shall be laid bare before the unbelievers, who have turned a blind eye to My admonition and a deaf ear to My warning.
We see here another instance of that lack of coherence which is not uncommon in the KoranHow are we to account for this apparently abrupt transition to Dhulqarnein, the Two-horned One, that is to say, Alexander the Great? Apart from the unheard-of anachronism (Mohammed's chronology in general leaves much to be desired), one does not quite understand why Alexander is brought in here at allBut it has to be borne in mind that Khidr and Dhulqarnein are the great pair of friends, altogether comparable to the Dioscuri, as Vollers rightly emphasizesThe psychological connection may therefore be presumed to be as follows: Moses has had a profoundly moving experience of the self, which brought unconscious processes before his eyes with overwhelming clarityAfterwards, when he comes to his people, the Jews, who are counted among the infidels, and wants to tell them about his experience, he prefers to use the form of a mystery legendInstead of speaking about himself, he speaks about the Two-horned OneSince Moses himself is also horned, the substitution of Dhulqarnein appears plausibleThen he has to relate the history of this friendship and describe how Khidr helped his friendDhulqarnein makes his way to the setting of the sun and then to its risingThat is, he describes the way of the renewal of the sun, through death and darkness to a new resurrectionAll this again indicates that it is Khidr who not only stands by man in his bodily needs but also helps him to attain rebirthThe Koran, it is true, makes no distinction in this narrative between Allah, who is speaking in the first person plural, and KhidrBut it is clear that this section is simply a continuation of the helpful actions described previously, from which it is evident that Khidr is a symbolization or incarnation of AllahThe friendship between Khidr and Alexander plays an especially prominent part in the commentaries, as does also the connection with the prophet ElijahVollers does not hesitate to extend the comparison to that other pair of friends, Gilgamesh and Enkidu.
To sum up, then: Moses has to recount the deeds of the two friends to his people in the manner of an impersonal mystery legendPsychologically this means that the transformation has to be described or felt as happening to the other. Although it is Moses himself who, in his experience with Khidr, stands in Dhulqarnein's place, he has to name the latter instead of himself in telling the storyThis can hardly be accidental, for the great psychic danger which is always connected with individuation, or the development of the self, lies in the identification of ego-consciousness with the selfThis produces an inflation which threatens consciousness with dissolutionAll the more primitive or older cultures show a fine sense for the perils of the soul and for the dangerousness and general unreliability of the godsThat is, they have not yet lost their psychic instinct for the barely perceptible and yet vital processes going on in the background, which can hardly be said of our modern cultureTo be sure, we have before our eyes as a warning just such a pair of friends distorted by inflation—Nietzsche and Zarathustra—but the warning has not been heededAnd what are we to make of Faust and Mephistopheles? The Faustian hybris is already the first step towards madnessThe fact that the unimpressive beginning of the transformation in Faust is a dog and not an edible fish, and that the transformed figure is the devil and not a wise friend, endowed with Our grace and Our wisdom, might, I am inclined to think, offer a key to our understanding of the highly enigmatic Germanic soul.
Without entering into other details of the text, I would like to draw attention to one more point: the building of the rampart against Gog and Magog (also known as Yajuj and Majuj)This motif is a repetition of Khidr's last deed in the previous episode, the rebuilding of the town wallBut this time the wall is to be a strong defence against Gog and MagogThe passage may possibly refer to Revelation :f(AV):
And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the seaAnd they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city.
Here Dhulqarnein takes over the role of Khidr and builds an unscalable rampart for the people living between Two Mountains. This is obviously the same place in the middle which is to be protected against Gog and Magog, the featureless, hostile massesPsychologically, it is again a question of the self, enthroned in the place of the middle, and referred to in Revelation as the beloved city (Jerusalem, the centre of the earth)The self is the hero, threatened already at birth by envious collective forces; the jewel that is coveted by all and arouses jealous strife; and finally the god who is dismembered by the old, evil power of darknessIn its psychological meaning, individuation is an opus contra naturam, which creates a horror vacui in the collective layer and is only too likely to collapse under the impact of the collective forces of the psycheThe mystery legend of the two helpful friends promises protection to him who has found the jewel on his questBut there will come a time when, in accordance with Allah's providence, even the iron rampart will fall to pieces, namely, on the day when the world comes to an end, or psychologically speaking, when individual consciousness is extinguished in the waters of darkness, that is to say when a subjective end of the world is experiencedBy this is meant the moment when consciousness sinks back into the darkness from which it originally emerged, like Khidr's island: the moment of death.
The legend then continues along eschatological lines: on that day (the day of the Last Judgment) the light returns to eternal light and the darkness to eternal darknessThe opposites are separated and a timeless state of permanence sets in, which, because of the absolute separation of opposites, is nevertheless one of supreme tension and therefore corresponds to the improbable initial stateThis is in contrast to the view which sees the end as a complexio oppositorum.
With this prospect of eternity, Paradise, and Hell the Eighteenth Sura comes to an endIn spite of its apparently disconnected and allusive character, it gives an almost perfect picture of a psychic transformation or rebirth which today, with our greater psychological insight, we would recognize as an individuation processBecause of the great age of the legend and the Islamic prophet's primitive cast of mind, the process takes place entirely outside the sphere of consciousness and is projected in the form of a mystery legend of a friend or a pair of friends and the deeds they performThat is why it is all so allusive and lacking in logical sequenceNevertheless, the legend expresses the obscure archetype of transformation so admirably that the passionate religious eros of the Arab finds it completely satisfyingIt is for this reason that the figure of Khidr plays such an important part in Islamic mysticism.
The author of the companion essay on the mythology of the child or the child god has asked me for a psychological commentary on the subject of his investigationsI am glad to accede to his request, although the undertaking seems to me no small venture in view of the great significance of the child motif in mythologyKerényi himself has enlarged upon the occurrence of this motif in Greece and Rome, with parallels drawn from Indian, Finnish, and other sources, thus indicating that the presentation of the theme would allow of yet further extensionsThough a comprehensive description would contribute nothing decisive in principle, it would nevertheless produce an overwhelming impression of the world-wide incidence and frequency of the motifThe customary treatment of mythological motifs so far in separate departments of science, such as philology, ethnology, the history of civilization, and comparative religion, was not exactly a help to us in recognizing their universality; and the psychological problems raised by this universality could easily be shelved by hypotheses of migrationConsequently Adolf Bastian's ideas met with little success in their dayEven then there was sufficient empirical material available to permit far-reaching psychological conclusions, but the necessary premises were lackingAlthough the psychological knowledge of that time included myth-formation in its province—witness Wundt's Völkerpsychologie—it was not in a position to demonstrate this same process as a living function actually present in the psyche of civilized man, any more than it could understand mythological motifs as structural elements of the psycheTrue to its history, when psychology was metaphysics first of all, then the study of the senses and their functions, and then of the conscious mind and its functions, psychology identified its proper subject with the conscious psyche and its contents and thus completely overlooked the existence of a nonconscious psycheAlthough various philosophers, among them Leibniz, Kant, and Schelling, had already pointed very clearly to the problem of the dark side of the psyche, it was a physician who felt impelled, from his scientific and medical experience, to point to the unconscious as the essential basis of the psycheThis was CGCarus, the authority whom Eduard von Hartmann followedIn recent times it was, once again, medical psychology that approached the problem of the unconscious without philosophical preconceptionsIt became clear from many separate investigations that the psychopathology of the neuroses and of many psychoses cannot dispense with the hypothesis of a dark side of the psyche, i.e., the unconsciousIt is the same with the psychology of dreams, which is really the terra intermedia between normal and pathological psychologyIn the dream, as in the products of psychoses, there are numberless interconnections to which one can find parallels only in mythological associations of ideas (or perhaps in certain poetic creations which are often characterized by a borrowing, not always conscious, from myths)Had thorough investigation shown that in the majority of such cases it was simply a matter of forgotten knowledge, the physician would not have gone to the trouble of making extensive researches into individual and collective parallelsBut, in point of fact, typical mythologems were observed among individuals to whom all knowledge of this kind was absolutely out of the question, and where indirect derivation from religious ideas that might have been known to them, or from popular figures of speech, was impossibleSuch conclusions forced us to assume that we must be dealing with autochthonous revivals independent of all tradition, and, consequently, that myth-forming structural elements must be present in the unconscious psyche.
These products are never (or at least very seldom) myths with a definite form, but rather mythological components which, because of their typical nature, we can call motifs, primordial images, types or—as I have named them—archetypesThe child archetype is an excellent exampleToday we can hazard the formula that the archetypes appear in myths and fairytales just as they do in dreams and in the products of psychotic fantasyThe medium in which they are embedded is, in the former case, an ordered and for the most part immediately understandable context, but in the latter case a generally unintelligible, irrational, not to say delirious sequence of images which nonetheless does not lack a certain hidden coherenceIn the individual, the archetypes appear as involuntary manifestations of unconscious processes whose existence and meaning can only be inferred, whereas the myth deals with traditional forms of incalculable ageThey hark back to a prehistoric world whose spiritual preconceptions and general conditions we can still observe today among existing primitivesMyths on this level are as a rule tribal history handed down from generation to generation by word of mouthPrimitive mentality differs from the civilized chiefly in that the conscious mind is far less developed in scope and intensityFunctions such as thinking, willing, etcare not yet differentiated; they are pre-conscious, and in the case of thinking, for instance, this shows itself in the circumstance that the primitive does not think consciously, but that thoughts appearThe primitive cannot assert that he thinks; it is rather that something thinks in him. The spontaneity of the act of thinking does not lie, causally, in his conscious mind, but in his unconsciousMoreover, he is incapable of any conscious effort of will; he must put himself beforehand into the mood of willing, or let himself be put—hence his rites d'entrée et de sortieHis consciousness is menaced by an almighty unconscious: hence his fear of magical influences which may cross his path at any moment; and for this reason, too, he is surrounded by unknown forces and must adjust himself to them as best he canOwing to the chronic twilight state of his consciousness, it is often next to impossible to find out whether he merely dreamed something or whether he really experienced itThe spontaneous manifestation of the unconscious and its archetypes intrudes everywhere into his conscious mind, and the mythical world of his ancestors—for instance, the alchera or bugari of the Australian aborigines—is a reality equal if not superior to the material worldIt is not the world as we know it that speaks out of his unconscious, but the unknown world of the psyche, of which we know that it mirrors our empirical world only in part, and that, for the other part, it moulds this empirical world in accordance with its own psychic assumptionsThe archetype does not proceed from physical facts, but describes how the psyche experiences the physical fact, and in so doing the psyche often behaves so autocratically that it denies tangible reality or makes statements that fly in the face of it.
The primitive mentality does not invent myths, it experiences themMyths are original revelations of the preconscious psyche, involuntary statements about unconscious psychic happenings, and anything but allegories of physical processesSuch allegories would be an idle amusement for an unscientific intellectMyths, on the contrary, have a vital meaningNot merely do they represent, they are the psychic life of the primitive tribe, which immediately falls to pieces and decays when it loses its mythological heritage, like a man who has lost his soulA tribe's mythology is its living religion, whose loss is always and everywhere, even among the civilized, a moral catastropheBut religion is a vital link with psychic processes independent of and beyond consciousness, in the dark hinterland of the psycheMany of these unconscious processes may be indirectly occasioned by consciousness, but never by conscious choiceOthers appear to arise spontaneously, that is to say, from no discernible or demonstrable conscious cause.
Modern psychology treats the products of unconscious fantasy-activity as self-portraits of what is going on in the unconscious, or as statements of the unconscious psyche about itselfThey fall into two categoriesFirst, fantasies (including dreams) of a personal character, which go back unquestionably to personal experiences, things forgotten or repressed, and can thus be completely explained by individual anamnesisSecond, fantasies (including dreams) of an impersonal character, which cannot be reduced to experiences in the individual's past, and thus cannot be explained as something individually acquiredThese fantasy-images undoubtedly have their closest analogues in mythological typesWe must therefore assume that they correspond to certain collective (and not personal) structural elements of the human psyche in general, and, like the morphological elements of the human body, are inheritedAlthough tradition and transmission by migration certainly play a part, there are, as we have said, very many cases that cannot be accounted for in this way and drive us to the hypothesis of autochthonous revival. These cases are so numerous that we are obliged to assume the existence of a collective psychic substratumI have called this the collective unconscious.
The products of this second category resemble the types of structures to be met with in myth and fairytale so much that we must regard them as relatedIt is therefore wholly within the realm of possibility that both, the mythological types as well as the individual types, arise under quite similar conditionsAs already mentioned, the fantasy-products of the second category (as also those of the first) arise in a state of reduced intensity of consciousness (in dreams, delirium, reveries, visions, etc.)In all these states the check put upon unconscious contents by the concentration of the conscious mind ceases, so that the hitherto unconscious material streams, as though from opened side-sluices, into the field of consciousnessThis mode of origination is the general rule.
Reduced intensity of consciousness and absence of concentration and attention, Janet's abaissement du niveau mental, correspond pretty exactly to the primitive state of consciousness in which, we must suppose, myths were originally formedIt is therefore exceedingly probable that the mythological archetypes, too, made their appearance in much the same manner as the manifestations of archetypal structures among individuals today.
The methodological principle in accordance with which psychology treats the products of the unconscious is this: Contents of an archetypal character are manifestations of processes in the collective unconsciousHence they do not refer to anything that is or has been conscious, but to something essentially unconsciousIn the last analysis, therefore, it is impossible to say what they refer toEvery interpretation necessarily remains an as-if. The ultimate core of meaning may be circumscribed, but not describedEven so, the bare circumscription denotes an essential step forward in our knowledge of the pre-conscious structure of the psyche, which was already in existence when there was as yet no unity of personality (even today the primitive is not securely possessed of it) and no consciousness at allWe can also observe this pre-conscious state in early childhood, and as a matter of fact it is the dreams of this early period that not infrequently bring extremely remarkable archetypal contents to light.
If, then, we proceed in accordance with the above principle, there is no longer any question whether a myth refers to the sun or the moon, the father or the mother, sexuality or fire or water; all it does is to circumscribe and give an approximate description of an unconscious core of meaningThe ultimate meaning of this nucleus was never conscious and never will beIt was, and still is, only interpreted, and every interpretation that comes anywhere near the hidden sense (or, from the point of view of scientific intellect, nonsense, which comes to the same thing) has always, right from the beginning, laid claim not only to absolute truth and validity but to instant reverence and religious devotionArchetypes were, and still are, living psychic forces that demand to be taken seriously, and they have a strange way of making sure of their effectAlways they were the bringers of protection and salvation, and their violation has as its consequence the perils of the soul known to us from the psychology of primitivesMoreover, they are the unfailing causes of neurotic and even psychotic disorders, behaving exactly like neglected or maltreated physical organs or organic functional systems.
An archetypal content expresses itself, first and foremost, in metaphorsIf such a content should speak of the sun and identify with it the lion, the king, the hoard of gold guarded by the dragon, or the power that makes for the life and health of man, it is neither the one thing nor the other, but the unknown third thing that finds more or less adequate expression in all these similes, yet—to the perpetual vexation of the intellect—remains unknown and not to be fitted into a formulaFor this reason the scientific intellect is always inclined to put on airs of enlightenment in the hope of banishing the spectre once and for allWhether its endeavours were called euhemerism, or Christian apologetics, or Enlightenment in the narrow sense, or Positivism, there was always a myth hiding behind it, in new and disconcerting garb, which then, following the ancient and venerable pattern, gave itself out as ultimate truthIn reality we can never legitimately cut loose from our archetypal foundations unless we are prepared to pay the price of a neurosis, any more than we can rid ourselves of our body and its organs without committing suicideIf we cannot deny the archetypes or otherwise neutralize them, we are confronted, at every new stage in the differentiation of consciousness to which civilization attains, with the task of finding a new interpretation appropriate to this stage, in order to connect the life of the past that still exists in us with the life of the present, which threatens to slip away from itIf this link-up does not take place, a kind of rootless consciousness comes into being no longer oriented to the past, a consciousness which succumbs helplessly to all manner of suggestions and, in practice, is susceptible to psychic epidemicsWith the loss of the past, now become insignificant, devalued, and incapable of revaluation, the saviour is lost too, for the saviour is either the insignificant thing itself or else arises out of itOver and over again in the metamorphosis of the gods he rises up as the prophet or first-born of a new generation and appears unexpectedly in the unlikeliest places (sprung from a stone, tree, furrow, water, etc.) and in ambiguous form (Tom Thumb, dwarf, child, animal, and so on).
This archetype of the child god is extremely widespread and intimately bound up with all the other mythological aspects of the child motifIt is hardly necessary to allude to the still living Christ-child, who, in the legend of Saint Christopher, also has the typical feature of being smaller than small and bigger than big. In folklore the child motif appears in the guise of the dwarf or the elf as personifications of the hidden forces of natureTo this sphere also belongs the little metal man of late antiquity, the áνθρωπáριον, who, till far into the Middle Ages, on the one hand inhabited the mine-shafts, and on the other represented the alchemical metals, above all Mercurius reborn in perfect form (as the hermaphrodite, filius sapientiae, or in-fans noster)Thanks to the religious interpretation of the child, a fair amount of evidence has come down to us from the Middle Ages showing that the child was not merely a traditional figure, but a vision spontaneously experienced (as a so-called irruption of the unconscious)I would mention Meister Eckhart's vision of the naked boy and the dream of Brother EustachiusInteresting accounts of these spontaneous experiences are also to be found in English ghost-stories, where we read of the vision of a Radiant Boy said to have been seen in a place where there are Roman remainsThis apparition was supposed to be of evil omenIt almost looks as though we were dealing with the figure of a puer aeternus who had become inauspicious through metamorphosis, or in other words had shared the fate of the classical and the Germanic gods, who have all become bugbearsThe mystical character of the experience is also confirmed in Part II of Goethe's Faust, where Faust himself is transformed into a boy and admitted into the choir of blessed youths, this being the larval stage of Doctor Marianus.
In the strange tale called Das Reich ohne Raum, by Bruno Goetz, a puer aeternus named Fo (= Buddha) appears with whole troops of unholy boys of evil significance(Contemporary parallels are better let alone.) I mention this instance only to demonstrate the enduring vitality of the child archetype.
The child motif not infrequently occurs in the field of psychopathologyThe imaginary child is common among women with mental disorders and is usually interpreted in a Christian senseHomunculi also appear, as in the famous Schreber case, where they come in swarms and plague the suffererBut the clearest and most significant manifestation of the child motif in the therapy of neuroses is in the maturation process of personality induced by the analysis of the unconscious, which I have termed the process of individuationHere we are confronted with preconscious processes which, in the form of more or less well-formed fantasies, gradually pass over into the conscious mind, or become conscious as dreams, or, lastly, are made conscious through the method of active imaginationThis material is rich in archetypal motifs, among them frequently that of the childOften the child is formed after the Christian model; more often, though, it develops from earlier, altogether non-Christian levels—that is to say, out of chthonic animals such as crocodiles, dragons, serpents, or monkeysSometimes the child appears in the cup of a flower, or out of a golden egg, or as the centre of a mandalaIn dreams it often appears as the dreamer's son or daughter or as a boy, youth, or young girl; occasionally it seems to be of exotic origin, Indian or Chinese, with a dusky skin, or, appearing more cosmically, surrounded by stars or with a starry coronet; or as the king's son or the witch's child with daemonic attributesSeen as a special instance of the treasure hard to attain motif, the child motif is extremely variable and assumes all manner of shapes, such as the jewel, the pearl, the flower, the chalice, the golden egg, the quaternity, the golden ball, and so onIt can be interchanged with these and similar images almost without limit.
As to the psychology of our theme I must point out that every statement going beyond the purely phenomenal aspects of an archetype lays itself open to the criticism we have expressed aboveNot for a moment dare we succumb to the illusion that an archetype can be finally explained and disposed ofEven the best attempts at explanation are only more or less successful translations into another metaphorical language(Indeed, language itself is only an image.) The most we can do is to dream the myth onwards and give it a modern dressAnd whatever explanation or interpretation does to it, we do to our own souls as well, with corresponding results for our own well-beingThe archetype—let us never forget this—is a psychic organ present in all of usA bad explanation means a correspondingly bad attitude to this organ, which may thus be injuredBut the ultimate sufferer is the bad interpreter himselfHence the explanation should always be such that the functional significance of the archetype remains unimpaired, so that an adequate and meaningful connection between the conscious mind and the archetypes is assuredFor the archetype is an element of our psychic structure and thus a vital and necessary component in our psychic economyIt represents or personifies certain instinctive data of the dark, primitive psyche, the real but invisible roots of consciousnessOf what elementary importance the connection with these roots is, we see from the preoccupation of the primitive mentality with certain magic factors, which are nothing less than what we would call archetypesThis original form of religio (linking back) is the essence, the working basis of all religious life even today, and always will be, whatever future form this life may take.
There is no rational substitute for the archetype any more than there is for the cerebellum or the kidneysWe can examine the physical organs anatomically, histologically, and embryologicallyThis would correspond to an outline of archetypal phenomenology and its presentation in terms of comparative historyBut we only arrive at the meaning of a physical organ when we begin to ask teleological questionsHence the query arises: What is the biological purpose of the archetype? Just as physiology answers such a question for the body, so it is the business of psychology to answer it for the archetype.
Statements like The child motif is a vestigial memory of one's own childhood and similar explanations merely beg the questionBut if, giving this proposition a slight twist, we were to say, The child motif is a picture of certain forgotten things in our childhood, we are getting closer to the truthSince, however, the archetype is always an image belonging to the whole human race and not merely to the individual, we might put it better this way: The child motif represents the preconscious, childhood aspect of the collective psyche.
We shall not go wrong if we take this statement for the time being historically, on the analogy of certain psychological experiences which show that certain phases in an individual's life can become autonomous, can personify themselves to the extent that they result in a vision of oneself—for instance, one sees oneself as a childVisionary experiences of this kind, whether they occur in dreams or in the waking state, are, as we know, conditional on a dissociation having previously taken place between past and presentSuch dissociations come about because of various incompatibilities; for instance, a man's present state may have come into conflict with his childhood state, or he may have violently sundered himself from his original character in the interests of some arbitrary persona more in keeping with his ambitionsHe has thus become unchildlike and artificial, and has lost his rootsAll this presents a favourable opportunity for an equally vehement confrontation with the primary truth.
In view of the fact that men have not yet ceased to make statements about the child god, we may perhaps extend the individual analogy to the life of mankind and say in conclusion that humanity, too, probably always comes into conflict with its childhood conditions, that is, with its original, unconscious, and instinctive state, and that the danger of the kind of conflict which induces the vision of the child actually existsReligious observances, i.e., the retelling and ritual repetition of the mythical event, consequently serve the purpose of bringing the image of childhood, and everything connected with it, again and again before the eyes of the conscious mind so that the link with the original condition may not be broken.
The child motif represents not only something that existed in the distant past but also something that exists now; that is to say, it is not just a vestige but a system functioning in the present whose purpose is to compensate or correct, in a meaningful manner, the inevitable one-sidednesses and extravagances of the conscious mindIt is in the nature of the conscious mind to concentrate on relatively few contents and to raise them to the highest pitch of clarityA necessary result and precondition is the exclusion of other potential contents of consciousnessThe exclusion is bound to bring about a certain one-sidedness of the conscious contentsSince the differentiated consciousness of civilized man has been granted an effective instrument for the practical realization of its contents through the dynamics of his will, there is all the more danger, the more he trains his will, of his getting lost in one-sidedness and deviating further and further from the laws and roots of his beingThis means, on the one hand, the possibility of human freedom, but on the other it is a source of endless transgressions against one's instinctsAccordingly, primitive man, being closer to his instincts, like the animal, is characterized by fear of novelty and adherence to traditionTo our way of thinking he is painfully backward, whereas we exalt progressBut our progressiveness, though it may result in a great many delightful wish-fulfilments, piles up an equally gigantic Promethean debt which has to be paid off from time to time in the form of hideous catastrophesFor ages man has dreamed of flying, and all we have got for it is saturation bombing! We smile today at the Christian hope of a life beyond the grave, and yet we often fall into chiliasms a hundred times more ridiculous than the notion of a happy HereafterOur differentiated consciousness is in continual danger of being uprooted; hence it needs compensation through the still existing state of childhood.
The symptoms of compensation are described, from the progressive point of view, in scarcely flattering termsSince, to the superficial eye, it looks like a retarding operation, people speak of inertia, backwardness, scepticism, fault-finding, conservatism, timidity, pettiness, and so onBut inasmuch as man has, in high degree, the capacity for cutting himself off from his own roots, he may also be swept uncritically to catastrophe by his dangerous one-sidednessThe retarding ideal is always more primitive, more natural (in the good sense as in the bad), and more moral in that it keeps faith with law and traditionThe progressive ideal is always more abstract, more unnatural, and less moral in that it demands disloyalty to traditionProgress enforced by will is always convulsiveBackwardness may be closer to naturalness, but in its turn it is always menaced by painful awakeningsThe older view of things realized that progress is only possible Deo concedente, thus proving itself conscious of the opposites and repeating the age-old rites d'entrée et de sortie on a higher planeThe more differentiated consciousness becomes, the greater the danger of severance from the root-conditionComplete severance comes when the Deo concedente is forgottenNow it is an axiom of psychology that when a part of the psyche is split off from consciousness it is only apparently inactivated; in actual fact it brings about a possession of the personality, with the result that the individual's aims are falsified in the interests of the split-off partIf, then, the childhood state of the collective psyche is repressed to the point of total exclusion, the unconscious content overwhelms the conscious aim and inhibits, falsifies, even destroys its realizationViable progress only comes from the co-operation of both.
One of the essential features of the child motif is its futurityThe child is potential futureHence the occurrence of the child motif in the psychology of the individual signifies as a rule an anticipation of future developments, even though at first sight it may seem like a retrospective configurationLife is a flux, a flowing into the future, and not a stoppage or a backwashIt is therefore not surprising that so many of the mythological saviours are child godsThis agrees exactly with our experience of the psychology of the individual, which shows that the child paves the way for a future change of personalityIn the individuation process, it anticipates the figure that comes from the synthesis of conscious and unconscious elements in the personalityIt is therefore a symbol which unites the opposites; a mediator, bringer of healing, that is, one who makes wholeBecause it has this meaning, the child motif is capable of the numerous transformations mentioned above: it can be expressed by roundness, the circle or sphere, or else by the quaternity as another form of wholenessI have called this wholeness that transcends consciousness the self. The goal of the individuation process is the synthesis of the selfFrom another point of view the term entelechy might be preferable to synthesis. There is an empirical reason why entelechy is, in certain conditions, more fitting: the symbols of wholeness frequently occur at the beginning of the individuation process, indeed they can often be observed in the first dreams of early infancyThis observation says much for the a priori existence of potential wholeness, and on this account the idea of entelechy instantly recommends itselfBut in so far as the individuation process occurs, empirically speaking, as a synthesis, it looks, paradoxically enough, as if something already existent were being put togetherFrom this point of view, the term synthesis is also applicable.
In the manifold phenomenology of the child we have to distinguish between the unity and plurality of its respective manifestationsWhere, for instance, numerous homunculi, dwarfs, boys, etc., appear, having no individual characteristics at all, there is the probability of a dissociationSuch forms are therefore found especially in schizophrenia, which is essentially a fragmentation of personalityThe many children then represent the products of its dissolutionBut if the plurality occurs in normal people, then it is the representation of an as yet incomplete synthesis of personalityThe personality (viz., the self) is still in the plural stage, i.e., an ego may be present, but it cannot experience its wholeness within the framework of its own personality, only within the community of the family, tribe, or nation; it is still in the stage of unconscious identification with the plurality of the groupThe Church takes due account of this widespread condition in her doctrine of the corpus mysticum, of which the individual is by nature a member.
If, however, the child motif appears in the form of a unity, we are dealing with an unconscious and provisionally complete synthesis of the personality, which in practice, like everything unconscious, signifies no more than a possibility.
Sometimes the child looks more like a child god, sometimes more like a young heroCommon to both types is the miraculous birth and the adversities of early childhood—abandonment and danger through persecutionThe god is by nature wholly supernatural; the hero's nature is human but raised to the limit of the supernatural—he is semi-divine. While the god, especially in his close affinity with the symbolic animal, personifies the collective unconscious which is not yet integrated into a human being, the hero's supernaturalness includes human nature and thus represents a synthesis of the (divine, i.e., not yet humanized) unconscious and human consciousnessConsequently he signifies the potential anticipation of an individuation process which is approaching wholeness.
For this reason the various child-fates may be regarded as illustrating the kind of psychic events that occur in the entelechy or genesis of the self. The miraculous birth tries to depict the way in which this genesis is experiencedSince it is a psychic genesis, everything must happen non-empirically, e.g., by means of a virgin birth, or by miraculous conception, or by birth from unnatural organsThe motifs of insignificance, exposure, abandonment, danger, etctry to show how precarious is the psychic possibility of wholeness, that is, the enormous difficulties to be met with in attaining this highest good. They also signify the powerlessness and helplessness of the life-urge which subjects every growing thing to the law of maximum self-fulfilment, while at the same time the environmental influences place all sorts of insuperable obstacles in the way of individuationMore especially the threat to one's inmost self from dragons and serpents points to the danger of the newly acquired consciousness being swallowed up again by the instinctive psyche, the unconsciousThe lower vertebrates have from earliest times been favourite symbols of the collective psychic substratum, which is localized anatomically in the subcortical centres, the cerebellum and the spinal cordThese organs constitute the snakeSnake-dreams usually occur, therefore, when the conscious mind is deviating from its instinctual basis.
The motif of smaller than small yet bigger than big complements the impotence of the child by means of its equally miraculous deedsThis paradox is the essence of the hero and runs through his whole destiny like a red threadHe can cope with the greatest perils, yet, in the end, something quite insignificant is his undoing: Baldur perishes because of the mistletoe, Maui because of the laughter of a little bird, Siegfried because of his one vulnerable spot, Heracles because of his wife's gift, others because of common treachery, and so on.
The hero's main feat is to overcome the monster of darkness: it is the long-hoped-for and expected triumph of consciousness over the unconsciousDay and light are synonyms for consciousness, night and dark for the unconsciousThe coming of consciousness was probably the most tremendous experience of primeval times, for with it a world came into being whose existence no one had suspected beforeAnd God said: Let there be light!' is the projection of that immemorial experience of the separation of the conscious from the unconsciousEven among primitives today the possession of a soul is a precarious thing, and the loss of soul a typical psychic malady which drives primitive medicine to all sorts of psychotherapeutic measuresHence the child distinguishes itself by deeds which point to the conquest of the dark.
Abandonment, exposure, danger, etcare all elaborations of the child's insignificant beginnings and of its mysterious and miraculous birthThis statement describes a certain psychic experience of a creative nature, whose object is the emergence of a new and as yet unknown contentIn the psychology of the individual there is always, at such moments, an agonizing situation of conflict from which there seems to be no way out—at least for the conscious mind, since as far as this is concerned, tertium non daturBut out of this collision of opposites the unconscious psyche always creates a third thing of an irrational nature, which the conscious mind neither expects nor understandsIt presents itself in a form that is neither a straight yes nor a straight no, and is consequently rejected by bothFor the conscious mind knows nothing beyond the opposites and, as a result, has no knowledge of the thing that unites themSince, however, the solution of the conflict through the union of opposites is of vital importance, and is moreover the very thing that the conscious mind is longing for, some inkling of the creative act, and of the significance of it, nevertheless gets throughFrom this comes the numinous character of the child. A meaningful but unknown content always has a secret fascination for the conscious mindThe new configuration is a nascent whole; it is on the way to wholeness, at least in so far as it excels in wholeness the conscious mind when torn by opposites and surpasses it in completenessFor this reason all uniting symbols have a redemptive significance.
Out of this situation the child emerges as a symbolic content, manifestly separated or even isolated from its background (the mother), but sometimes including the mother in its perilous situation, threatened on the one hand by the negative attitude of the conscious mind and on the other by the horror vacui of the unconscious, which is quite ready to swallow up all its progeny, since it produces them only in play, and destruction is an inescapable part of its playNothing in all the world welcomes this new birth, although it is the most precious fruit of Mother Nature herself, the most pregnant with the future, signifying a higher stage of self-realizationThat is why Nature, the world of the instincts, takes the child under its wing: it is nourished or protected by animals.
Child means something evolving towards independenceThis it cannot do without detaching itself from its origins: abandonment is therefore a necessary condition, not just a concomitant symptomThe conflict is not to be overcome by the conscious mind remaining caught between the opposites, and for this very reason it needs a symbol to point out the necessity of detaching itself from its originsBecause the symbol of the child fascinates and grips the conscious mind, its redemptive effect passes over into consciousness and brings about that separation from the conflict-situation which the conscious mind by itself was unable to achieveThe symbol anticipates a nascent state of consciousnessSo long as this is not actually in being, the child remains a mythological projection which requires religious repetition and renewal by ritualThe Christ Child, for instance, is a religious necessity only so long as the majority of men are incapable of giving psychological reality to the saying: Except ye become as little children…. Since all such developments and transitions are extraordinarily difficult and dangerous, it is no wonder that figures of this kind persist for hundreds or even thousands of yearsEverything that man should, and yet cannot, be or do—be it in a positive or negative sense—lives on as a mythological figure and anticipation alongside his consciousness, either as a religious projection or—what is still more dangerous—as unconscious contents which then project themselves spontaneously into incongruous objects, e.g., hygienic and other salvationist doctrines or practicesAll these are so many rationalized substitutes for mythology, and their unnaturalness does more harm than good.
The conflict-situation that offers no way out, the sort of situation that produces the child as the irrational third, is of course a formula appropriate only to a psychological, that is, modern stage of developmentIt is not strictly applicable to the psychic life of primitives, if only because primitive man's childlike range of consciousness still excludes a whole world of possible psychic experiencesSeen on the nature-level of the primitive, our modern moral conflict is still an objective calamity that threatens life itselfHence not a few child-figures are culture-heroes and thus identified with things that promote culture, e.g., fire, metal, corn, maize, etcAs bringers of light, that is, enlargers of consciousness, they overcome darkness, which is to say that they overcome the earlier unconscious stateHigher consciousness, or knowledge going beyond our present-day consciousness, is equivalent to being all alone in the worldThis loneliness expresses the conflict between the bearer or symbol of higher consciousness and his surroundingsThe conquerors of darkness go far back into primeval times, and, together with many other legends, prove that there once existed a state of original psychic distress, namely unconsciousnessHence in all probability the irrational fear which primitive man has of the dark even todayI found a form of religion among a tribe living on Mount Elgon that corresponded to pantheistic optimismTheir optimistic mood was, however, always in abeyance between six o'clock in the evening and six o'clock in the morning, during which time it was replaced by fear, for in the night the dark being Ayik has his dominion—the Maker of Fear. During the daytime there were no monster snakes anywhere in the vicinity, but at night they were lurking on every pathAt night the whole of mythology was let loose.
It is a striking paradox in all child myths that the child is on the one hand delivered helpless into the power of terrible enemies and in continual danger of extinction, while on the other he possesses powers far exceeding those of ordinary humanityThis is closely related to the psychological fact that though the child may be insignificant, unknown, a mere child, he is also divineFrom the conscious standpoint we seem to be dealing with an insignificant content that has no releasing, let alone redeeming, characterThe conscious mind is caught in its conflict-situation, and the combatant forces seem so overwhelming that the child as an isolated content bears no relation to the conscious factorsIt is therefore easily overlooked and falls back into the unconsciousAt least, this is what we should have to fear if things turned out according to our conscious expectationsMyth, however, emphasizes that it is not so, but that the child is endowed with superior powers and, despite all dangers, will unexpectedly pull throughThe child is born out of the womb of the unconscious, begotten out of the depths of human nature, or rather out of living Nature herselfIt is a personification of vital forces quite outside the limited range of our conscious mind; of ways and possibilities of which our one-sided conscious mind knows nothing; a wholeness which embraces the very depths of NatureIt represents the strongest, the most ineluctable urge in every being, namely the urge to realize itselfIt is, as it were, an incarnation of the inability to do otherwise, equipped with all the powers of nature and instinct, whereas the conscious mind is always getting caught up in its supposed ability to do otherwiseThe urge and compulsion to self-realization is a law of nature and thus of invincible power, even though its effect, at the start, is insignificant and improbableIts power is revealed in the miraculous deeds of the child hero, and later in the athla (works') of the bondsman or thrall (of the Heracles type), where, although the hero has outgrown the impotence of the child, he is still in a menial positionThe figure of the thrall generally leads up to the real epiphany of the semi-divine heroOddly enough, we have a similar modulation of themes in alchemy—in the synonyms for the lapisAs the materia prima, it is the lapis exilis et vilisAs a substance in process of transmutation, it is servus rubeus or fugitivus; and finally, in its true apotheosis, it attains the dignity of a filius sapientiae or deus terrenus, a light above all lights, a power that contains in itself all the powers of the upper and nether regionsIt becomes a corpus glorificatum which enjoys everlasting incorruptibility and is therefore a panacea (bringer of healing)The size and invincibility of the child are bound up in Hindu speculation with the nature of the atman, which corresponds to the smaller than small yet bigger than big motifAs an individual phenomenon, the self is smaller than small; as the equivalent of the cosmos, it is bigger than big. The self, regarded as the counter-pole of the world, its absolutely other, is the sine qua non of all empirical knowledge and consciousness of subject and objectOnly because of this psychic otherness is consciousness possible at allIdentity does not make consciousness possible; it is only separation, detachment, and agonizing confrontation through opposition that produce consciousness and insightHindu introspection recognized this psychological fact very early and consequently equated the subject of cognition with the subject of ontology in generalIn accordance with the predominantly introverted attitude of Indian thinking, the object lost the attribute of absolute reality and, in some systems, became a mere illusionThe Greek-Occidental type of mind could not free itself from the conviction of the world's absolute existence—at the cost, however, of the cosmic significance of the selfEven today Western man finds it hard to see the psychological necessity for a transcendental subject of cognition as the counter-pole of the empirical universe, although the postulate of a world-confronting self, at least as a point of reflection, is a logical necessityRegardless of philosophy's perpetual attitude of dissent or only half-hearted assent, there is always a compensating tendency in our unconscious psyche to produce a symbol of the self in its cosmic significanceThese efforts take on the archetypal forms of the hero myth such as can be observed in almost any individuation process.
The phenomenology of the child's birth always points back to an original psychological state of non-recognition, i.e., of darkness or twilight, of non-differentiation between subject and object, of unconscious identity of man and the universeThis phase of non-differentiation produces the golden egg, which is both man and universe and yet neither, but an irrational thirdTo the twilight consciousness of primitive man it seems as if the egg came out of the womb of the wide world and were, accordingly, a cosmic, objective, external occurrenceTo a differentiated consciousness, on the other hand, it seems evident that this egg is nothing but a symbol thrown up by the psyche or—what is even worse—a fanciful speculation and therefore nothing but a primitive phantasm to which no reality of any kind attachesPresent-day medical psychology, however, thinks somewhat differently about these phantasms. It knows only too well what dire disturbances of the bodily functions and what devastating psychic consequences can flow from mere fantasiesFantasies are the natural expressions of the life of the unconsciousBut since the unconscious is the psyche of all the body's autonomous functional complexes, its fantasies have an aetiological significance that is not to be despisedFrom the psychopathology of the individuation process we know that the formation of symbols is frequently associated with physical disorders of a psychic origin, which in some cases are felt as decidedly real. In medicine, fantasies are real things with which the psychotherapist has to reckon very seriously indeedHe cannot therefore deprive of all justification those primitive phantasms whose content is so real that it is projected upon the external worldIn the last analysis the human body, too, is built of the stuff of the world, the very stuff wherein fantasies become visible; indeed, without it they could not be experienced at allWithout this stuff they would be like a sort of abstract crystalline lattice in a solution where the crystallization process had not yet started.
The symbols of the self arise in the depths of the body and they express its materiality every bit as much as the structure of the perceiving consciousnessThe symbol is thus a living body, corpus et anima; hence the child is such an apt formula for the symbolThe uniqueness of the psyche can never enter wholly into reality, it can only be realized approximately, though it still remains the absolute basis of all consciousnessThe deeper layers of the psyche lose their individual uniqueness as they retreat farther and farther into darknessLower down, that is to say as they approach the autonomous functional systems, they become increasingly collective until they are universalized and extinguished in the body's materiality, i.e., in chemical substancesThe body's carbon is simply carbonHence at bottom the psyche is simply world. In this sense I hold Kerényi to be absolutely right when he says that in the symbol the world itself is speakingThe more archaic and deeper, that is the more physiological, the symbol is, the more collective and universal, the more material it isThe more abstract, differentiated, and specific it is, and the more its nature approximates to conscious uniqueness and individuality, the more it sloughs off its universal characterHaving finally attained full consciousness, it runs the risk of becoming a mere allegory which nowhere oversteps the bounds of conscious comprehension, and is then exposed to all sorts of attempts at rationalistic and therefore inadequate explanation.
It is a remarkable fact that perhaps the majority of cosmogonic gods are of a bisexual natureThe hermaphrodite means nothing less than a union of the strongest and most striking oppositesIn the first place this union refers back to a primitive state of mind, a twilight where differences and contrasts were either barely separated or completely mergedWith increasing clarity of consciousness, however, the opposites draw more and more distinctly and irreconcilably apartIf, therefore, the hermaphrodite were only a product of primitive non-differentiation, we would have to expect that it would soon be eliminated with increasing civilizationThis is by no means the case; on the contrary, man's imagination has been preoccupied with this idea over and over again on the high and even the highest levels of culture, as we can see from the late Greek and syncretic philosophy of GnosticismThe hermaphroditic rebis has an important part to play in the natural philosophy of the Middle AgesAnd in our own day we hear of Christ's androgyny in Catholic mysticism.
We can no longer be dealing, then, with the continued existence of a primitive phantasm, or with an original contamination of oppositesRather, as we can see from medieval writings, the primordial idea has become a symbol of the creative union of opposites, a uniting symbol in the literal senseIn its functional significance the symbol no longer points back, but forward to a goal not yet reachedNotwithstanding its monstrosity, the hermaphrodite has gradually turned into a subduer of conflicts and a bringer of healing, and it acquired this meaning in relatively early phases of civilizationThis vital meaning explains why the image of the hermaphrodite did not fade out in primeval times but, on the contrary, was able to assert itself with increasing profundity of symbolic content for thousands of yearsThe fact that an idea so utterly archaic could rise to such exalted heights of meaning not only points to the vitality of archetypal ideas, it also demonstrates the rightness of the principle that the archetype, because of its power to unite opposites, mediates between the unconscious substratum and the conscious mindIt throws a bridge between present-day consciousness, always in danger of losing its roots, and the natural, unconscious, instinctive wholeness of primeval timesThrough this mediation the uniqueness, peculiarity, and one-sidedness of our present individual consciousness are linked up again with its natural, racial rootsProgress and development are ideals not lightly to be rejected, but they lose all meaning if man only arrives at his new state as a fragment of himself, having left his essential hinterland behind him in the shadow of the unconscious, in a state of primitivity or, indeed, barbarismThe conscious mind, split off from its origins, incapable of realizing the meaning of the new state, then relapses all too easily into a situation far worse than the one from which the innovation was intended to free it—exempla sunt odiosa! It was Friedrich Schiller who first had an inkling of this problem; but neither his contemporaries nor his successors were capable of drawing any conclusionsInstead, people incline more than ever to educate children and nothing moreI therefore suspect that the furor paedogogicus is a god-sent method of by-passing the central problem touched on by Schiller, namely the education of the educatorChildren are educated by what the grownup is and not by what he saysThe popular faith in words is a veritable disease of the mind, for a superstition of this sort always leads farther and farther away from man's foundations and seduces people into a disastrous identification of the personality with whatever slogan may be in vogueMeanwhile everything that has been overcome and left behind by so-called progress sinks deeper and deeper into the unconscious, from which there re-emerges in the end the primitive condition of identity with the massInstead of the expected progress, this condition now becomes reality.
As civilization develops, the bisexual primordial being turns into a symbol of the unity of personality, a symbol of the self, where the war of opposites finds peaceIn this way the primordial being becomes the distant goal of man's self-development, having been from the very beginning a projection of his unconscious wholenessWholeness consists in the union of the conscious and the unconscious personalityJust as every individual derives from masculine and feminine genes, and the sex is determined by the predominance of the corresponding genes, so in the psyche it is only the conscious mind, in a man, that has the masculine sign, while the unconscious is by nature feminineThe reverse is true in the case of a womanAll I have done in my anima theory is to rediscover and reformulate this factIt had long been known.
The idea of the coniunctio of male and female, which became almost a technical term in Hermetic philosophy, appears in Gnosticism as the mysterium iniquitatis, probably not uninfluenced by the Old Testament divine marriage as performed, for instance, by HoseaSuch things are hinted at not only by certain traditional customs, but by the quotation from the Gospel according to the Egyptians in the second epistle of Clement: When the two shall be one, the outside as the inside, and the male with the female neither male nor female. Clement of Alexandria introduces this logion with the words: When ye have trampled on the garment of shame (with thy feet)…, which probably refers to the body; for Clement as well as Cassian (from whom the quotation was taken over), and the pseudo-Clement, too, interpreted the words in a spiritual sense, in contrast to the Gnostics, who would seem to have taken the coniunctio all too literallyThey took care, however, through the practice of abortion and other restrictions, that the biological meaning of their acts did not swamp the religious significance of the riteWhile, in Church mysticism, the primordial image of the hieros gamos was sublimated on a lofty plane and only occasionally—as for instance with Mechthild of Magdeburg—approached the physical sphere in emotional intensity, for the rest of the world it remained very much alive and continued to be the object of especial psychic preoccupationIn this respect the symbolical drawings of Opicinus de Canistris afford us an interesting glimpse of the way in which this primordial image was instrumental in uniting opposites, even in a pathological stateOn the other hand, in the Hermetic philosophy that throve in the Middle Ages the coniunctio was performed wholly in the physical realm in the admittedly abstract theory of the coniugium solis et lunae, which despite this drawback gave the creative imagination much occasion for anthropomorphic flights.
Such being the state of affairs, it is readily understandable that the primordial image of the hermaphrodite should reappear in modern psychology in the guise of the male-female antithesis, in other words as male consciousness and personified female unconsciousBut the psychological process of bringing things to consciousness has complicated the picture considerablyWhereas the old science was almost exclusively a field in which only the man's unconscious could project itself, the new psychology had to acknowledge the existence of an autonomous female psyche as wellHere the case is reversed, and a feminine consciousness confronts a masculine personification of the unconscious, which can no longer be called anima but animusThis discovery also complicates the problem of the coniunctio.
Originally this archetype played its part entirely in the field of fertility magic and thus remained for a very long time a purely biological phenomenon with no other purpose than that of fecundationBut even in early antiquity the symbolical meaning of the act seems to have increasedThus, for example, the physical performance of the hieros gamos as a sacred rite not only became a mystery—it faded to a mere conjectureAs we have seen, Gnosticism, too, endeavoured in all seriousness to subordinate the physiological to the metaphysicalFinally, the Church severed the coniunctio from the physical realm altogether, and natural philosophy turned it into an abstract theoriaThese developments meant the gradual transformation of the archetype into a psychological process which, in theory, we can call a combination of conscious and unconscious processesIn practice, however, it is not so simple, because as a rule the feminine unconscious of a man is projected upon a feminine partner, and the masculine unconscious of a woman is projected upon a manThe elucidation of these problems is a special branch of psychology and has no part in a discussion of the mythological hermaphrodite.
Faust, after his death, is received as a boy into the choir of blessed youths. I do not know whether Goethe was referring, with this peculiar idea, to the cupids on antique grave-stonesIt is not unthinkableThe figure of the cucullatus points to the hooded, that is, the invisible one, the genius of the departed, who reappears in the child-like frolics of a new life, surrounded by the sea-forms of dolphins and tritonsThe sea is the favourite symbol for the unconscious, the mother of all that livesJust as the child is, in certain circumstances (e.g., in the case of Hermes and the Dactyls), closely related to the phallus, symbol of the begetter, so it comes up again in the sepulchral phallus, symbol of a renewed begetting.
The child is therefore renatus in novam infantiamIt is thus both beginning and end, an initial and a terminal creatureThe initial creature existed before man was, and the terminal creature will be when man is notPsychologically speaking, this means that the child symbolizes the pre-conscious and the post-conscious essence of manHis pre-conscious essence is the unconscious state of earliest childhood; his post-conscious essence is an anticipation by analogy of life after deathIn this idea the all-embracing nature of psychic wholeness is expressedWholeness is never comprised within the compass of the conscious mind—it includes the indefinite and indefinable extent of the unconscious as wellWholeness, empirically speaking, is therefore of immeasurable extent, older and younger than consciousness and enfolding it in time and spaceThis is no speculation, but an immediate psychic experienceNot only is the conscious process continually accompanied, it is often guided, helped, or interrupted, by unconscious happeningsThe child had a psychic life before it had consciousnessEven the adult still says and does things whose significance he realizes only later, if everAnd yet he said them and did them as if he knew what they meantOur dreams are continually saying things beyond our conscious comprehension (which is why they are so useful in the therapy of neuroses)We have intimations and intuitions from unknown sourcesFears, moods, plans, and hopes come to us with no visible causationThese concrete experiences are at the bottom of our feeling that we know ourselves very little; at the bottom, too, of the painful conjecture that we might have surprises in store for ourselves.
Primitive man is no puzzle to himselfThe question What is man? is the question that man has always kept until lastPrimitive man has so much psyche outside his conscious mind that the experience of something psychic outside him is far more familiar to him than to usConsciousness hedged about by psychic powers, sustained or threatened or deluded by them, is the age-old experience of mankindThis experience has projected itself into the archetype of the child, which expresses man's wholenessThe child is all that is abandoned and exposed and at the same time divinely powerful; the insignificant, dubious beginning, and the triumphal endThe eternal child in man is an indescribable experience, an incongruity, a handicap, and a divine prerogative; an imponderable that determines the ultimate worth or worthlessness of a personality.
I am aware that a psychological commentary on the child archetype without detailed documentation must remain a mere sketchBut since this is virgin territory for the psychologist, my main endeavour has been to stake out the possible extent of the problems raised by our archetype and to describe, at least cursorily, its different aspectsClear-cut distinctions and strict formulations are quite impossible in this field, seeing that a kind of fluid interpenetration belongs to the very nature of all archetypesThey can only be roughly circumscribed at bestTheir living meaning comes out more from their presentation as a whole than from a single formulationEvery attempt to focus them more sharply is immediately punished by the intangible core of meaning losing its luminosityNo archetype can be reduced to a simple formulaIt is a vessel which we can never empty, and never fillIt has a potential existence only, and when it takes shape in matter it is no longer what it wasIt persists throughout the ages and requires interpreting ever anewThe archetypes are the imperishable elements of the unconscious, but they change their shape continually.
It is a well-nigh hopeless undertaking to tear a single archetype out of the living tissue of the psyche; but despite their interwovenness they do form units of meaning that can be apprehended intuitivelyPsychology, as one of the many expressions of psychic life, operates with ideas which in their turn are derived from archetypal structures and thus generate a somewhat more abstract kind of mythPsychology therefore translates the archaic speech of myth into a modern mythologem—not yet, of course, recognized as such—which constitutes one element of the myth science. This seemingly hopeless undertaking is a living and lived myth, satisfying to persons of a corresponding temperament, indeed beneficial in so far as they have been cut off from their psychic origins by neurotic dissociation.
As a matter of experience, we meet the child archetype in spontaneous and in therapeutically induced individuation processesThe first manifestation of the child is as a rule a totally unconscious phenomenonHere the patient identifies himself with his personal infantilismThen, under the influence of therapy, we get a more or less gradual separation from and objectification of the child, that is, the identity breaks down and is accompanied by an intensification (sometimes technically induced) of fantasy, with the result that archaic or mythological features become increasingly apparentFurther transformations run true to the hero mythThe theme of mighty feats is generally absent, but on the other hand the mythical dangers play all the greater partAt this stage there is usually another identification, this time with the hero, whose role is attractive for a variety of reasonsThe identification is often extremely stubborn and dangerous to the psychic equilibriumIf it can be broken down and if consciousness can be reduced to human proportions, the figure of the hero can gradually be differentiated into a symbol of the self.
In practical reality, however, it is of course not enough for the patient merely to know about such developments; what counts is his experience of the various transformationsThe initial stage of personal infantilism presents the picture of an abandoned or misunderstood and unjustly treated child with overweening pretensionsThe epiphany of the hero (the second identification) shows itself in a corresponding inflation: the colossal pretension grows into a conviction that one is something extraordinary, or else the impossibility of the pretension ever being fulfilled only proves one's own inferiority, which is favourable to the role of the heroic sufferer (a negative inflation)In spite of their contradictoriness, both forms are identical, because conscious megalomania is balanced by unconscious compensatory inferiority and conscious inferiority by unconscious megalomania (you never get one without the other)Once the reef of the second identification has been successfully circumnavigated, conscious processes can be cleanly separated from the unconscious, and the latter observed objectivelyThis leads to the possibility of an accommodation with the unconscious, and thus to a possible synthesis of the conscious and unconscious elements of knowledge and actionThis in turn leads to a shifting of the centre of personality from the ego to the self.
In this psychological framework the motifs of abandonment, invincibility, hermaphroditism, and beginning and end take their place as distinct categories of experience and understanding.
Not only is the figure of Demeter and the Kore in its threefold aspect as maiden, mother, and Hecate not unknown to the psychology of the unconscious, it is even something of a practical problemThe Kore has her psychological counterpart in those archetypes which I have called the self or supraordinate personality on the one hand, and the anima on the otherIn order to explain these figures, with which I cannot assume all readers to be familiar, I must begin with some remarks of a general nature.
The psychologist has to contend with the same difficulties as the mythologist when an exact definition or clear and concise information is demanded of himThe picture is concrete, clear, and subject to no misunderstandings only when it is seen in its habitual contextIn this form it tells us everything it containsBut as soon as one tries to abstract the real essence of the picture, the whole thing becomes cloudy and indistinctIn order to understand its living function, we must let it remain an organic thing in all its complexity and not try to examine the anatomy of its corpse in the manner of the scientist, or the archaeology of its ruins in the manner of the historianNaturally this is not to deny the justification of such methods when applied in their proper place.
In view of the enormous complexity of psychic phenomena, a purely phenomenological point of view is, and will be for a long time, the only possible one and the only one with any prospect of successWhence things come and what they are, these, particularly in the field of psychology, are questions which are apt to call forth untimely attempts at explanationSuch speculations are moreover based far more on unconscious philosophical premises than on the nature of the phenomena themselvesPsychic phenomena occasioned by unconscious processes are so rich and so multifarious that I prefer to describe my findings and observations and, where possible, to classify them—that is, to arrange them under certain definite typesThat is the method of natural science, and it is applied wherever we have to do with multifarious and still unorganized materialOne may question the utility or the appropriateness of the categories or types used in the arrangement, but not the correctness of the method itself.
Since for years I have been observing and investigating the products of the unconscious in the widest sense of the word, namely dreams, fantasies, visions, and delusions of the insane, I have not been able to avoid recognizing certain regularities, that is, typesThere are types of situations and types of figures that repeat themselves frequently and have a corresponding meaningI therefore employ the term motif to designate these repetitionsThus there are not only typical dreams but typical motifs in the dreamsThese may, as we have said, be situations or figuresAmong the latter there are human figures that can be arranged under a series of archetypes, the chief of them being, according to my suggestion, the shadow, the wise old man, the child (including the child hero), the mother (Primordial Mother and Earth Mother) as a supraordinate personality (daemonic because supraordinate), and her counterpart the maiden, and lastly the anima in man and the animus in woman.
The above types are far from exhausting all the statistical regularities in this respectThe figure of the Kore that interests us here belongs, when observed in a man, to the anima type; and when observed in a woman to the type of supraordinate personalityIt is an essential characteristic of psychic figures that they are duplex or at least capable of duplication; at all events they are bipolar and oscillate between their positive and negative meaningsThus the supraordinate personality can appear in a despicable and distorted form, like for instance Mephistopheles, who is really more positive as a personality than the vapid and unthinking careerist FaustAnother negative figure is the Tom Thumb or Tom Dumb of the folktalesThe figure corresponding to the Kore in a woman is generally a double one, i.e., a mother and a maiden, which is to say that she appears now as the one, now as the otherFrom this I would conclude, for a start, that in the formation of the Demeter-Kore myth the feminine influence so far outweighed the masculine that the latter had practically no significanceThe man's role in the Demeter myth is really only that of seducer or conqueror.
As a matter of practical observation, the Kore often appears in woman as an unknown young girl, not infrequently as Gretchen or the unmarried motherAnother frequent modulation is the dancer, who is often formed by borrowings from classical knowledge, in which case the maiden appears as the corybant, maenad, or nymphAn occasional variant is the nixie or water-sprite, who betrays her superhuman nature by her fishtailSometimes the Kore- and mother-figures slither down altogether to the animal kingdom, the favourite representatives then being the cat or the snake or the bear, or else some black monster of the underworld like the crocodile, or other salamander-like, saurian creaturesThe maiden's helplessness exposes her to all sorts of dangers, for instance of being devoured by reptiles or ritually slaughtered like a beast of sacrificeOften there are bloody, cruel, and even obscene orgies to which the innocent child falls victimSometimes it is a true nekyia, a descent into Hades and a quest for the treasure hard to attain, occasionally connected with orgiastic sexual rites or offerings of menstrual blood to the moonOddly enough, the various tortures and obscenities are carried out by an Earth Mother. There are drinkings of blood and bathings in blood, also crucifixionsThe maiden who crops up in case histories differs not inconsiderably from the vaguely flower-like Kore in that the modern figure is more sharply delineated and not nearly so unconscious, as the following examples will show.
The figures corresponding to Demeter and Hecate are supra-ordinate, not to say over-life-size Mothers ranging from the Pietà type to the Baubo typeThe unconscious, which acts as a counterbalance to woman's conventional innocuousness, proves to be highly inventive in this latter respectI can recall only very few cases where Demeter's own noble figure in its pure form breaks through as an image rising spontaneously from the unconsciousI remember a case, in fact, where a maiden-goddess appears clad all in purest white, but carrying a black monkey in her armsThe Earth Mother is always chthonic and is occasionally related to the moon, either through the blood-sacrifice already mentioned, or through a child-sacrifice, or else because she is adorned with a sickle moonIn pictorial or plastic representations the Mother is dark deepening to black, or red (these being her principal colours), and with a primitive or animal expression of face; in form she not infrequently resembles the neolithic ideal of the Venus of Brassempouy or that of Willendorf, or again the sleeper of Hal SaflieniNow and then I have come across multiple breasts, arranged like those of a sowThe Earth Mother plays an important part in the woman's unconscious, for all her manifestations are described as powerful. This shows that in such cases the Earth Mother element in the conscious mind is abnormally weak and requires strengthening.
In view of all this it is, I admit, hardly understandable why such figures should be reckoned as belonging to the type of supraordinate personality. In a scientific investigation, however, one has to disregard moral or aesthetic prejudices and let the facts speak for themselvesThe maiden is often described as not altogether human in the usual sense; she is either of unknown or peculiar origin, or she looks strange or undergoes strange experiences, from which one is forced to infer the maiden's extraordinary, myth-like natureEqually and still more strikingly, the Earth Mother is a divine being—in the classical senseMoreover, she does not by any means always appear in the guise of Baubo, but, for instance, more like Queen Venus in the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, though she is invariably heavy with destinyThe often unaesthetic forms of the Earth Mother are in keeping with a prejudice of the modern feminine unconscious; this prejudice was lacking in antiquityThe underworld nature of Hecate, who is closely connected with Demeter, and Persephone's fate both point nevertheless to the dark side of the human psyche, though not to the same extent as the modern material.
The supraordinate personality is the total man, i.e., man as he really is, not as he appears to himselfTo this wholeness the unconscious psyche also belongs, which has its requirements and needs just as consciousness hasI do not want to interpret the unconscious personalistically and assert, for instance, that fantasy-images like those described above are the wish-fulfilments due to repressionThese images were as such never conscious and consequently could never have been repressedI understand the unconscious rather as an impersonal psyche common to all men, even though it expresses itself through a personal consciousnessWhen anyone breathes, his breathing is not a phenomenon to be interpreted personallyThe mythological images belong to the structure of the unconscious and are an impersonal possession; in fact, the great majority of men are far more possessed by them than possessing themImages like those described above give rise under certain conditions to corresponding disturbances and symptoms, and it is then the task of medical therapy to find out whether and how and to what extent these impulses can be integrated with the conscious personality, or whether they are a secondary phenomenon which some defective orientation of consciousness has brought out of its normal potential state into actualityBoth possibilities exist in practice.
I usually describe the supraordinate personality as the self, thus making a sharp distinction between the ego, which, as is well known, extends only as far as the conscious mind, and the whole of the personality, which includes the unconscious as well as the conscious componentThe ego is thus related to the self as part to wholeTo that extent the self is supraordinateMoreover, the self is felt empirically not as subject but as object, and this by reason of its unconscious component, which can only come to consciousness indirectly, by way of projectionBecause of its unconscious component the self is so far removed from the conscious mind that it can only be partially expressed by human figures; the other part of it has to be expressed by objective, abstract symbolsThe human figures are father and son, mother and daughter, king and queen, god and goddessTheriomorphic symbols are the dragon, snake, elephant, lion, bear, and other powerful animals, or again the spider, crab, butterfly, beetle, worm, etcPlant symbols are generally flowers (lotus and rose)These lead on to geometrical figures like the circle, the sphere, the square, the quaternity, the clock, the firmament, and so onThe indefinite extent of the unconscious component makes a comprehensive description of the human personality impossibleAccordingly, the unconscious supplements the picture with living figures ranging from the animal to the divine, as the two extremes outside man, and rounds out the animal extreme, through the addition of vegetable and inorganic abstractions, into a microcosmThese addenda have a high frequency in anthropomorphic divinities, where they appear as attributes.
Demeter and Kore, mother and daughter, extend the feminine consciousness both upwards and downwardsThey add an older and younger, stronger and weaker dimension to it and widen out the narrowly limited conscious mind bound in space and time, giving it intimations of a greater and more comprehensive personality which has a share in the eternal course of thingsWe can hardly suppose that myth and mystery were invented for any conscious purpose; it seems much more likely that they were the involuntary revelation of a psychic, but unconscious, pre-conditionThe psyche pre-existent to consciousness (e.g., in the child) participates in the maternal psyche on the one hand, while on the other it reaches across to the daughter psycheWe could therefore say that every mother contains her daughter in herself and every daughter her mother, and that every woman extends backwards into her mother and forwards into her daughterThis participation and intermingling give rise to that peculiar uncertainty as regards time: a woman lives earlier as a mother, later as a daughterThe conscious experience of these ties produces the feeling that her life is spread out over generations—the first step towards the immediate experience and conviction of being outside time, which brings with it a feeling of immortalityThe individual's life is elevated into a type, indeed it becomes the archetype of woman's fate in generalThis leads to a restoration or apocatastasis of the lives of her ancestors, who now, through the bridge of the momentary individual, pass down into the generations of the futureAn experience of this kind gives the individual a place and a meaning in the life of the generations, so that all unnecessary obstacles are cleared out of the way of the life-stream that is to flow through herAt the same time the individual is rescued from her isolation and restored to wholenessAll ritual preoccupation with archetypes ultimately has this aim and this result.
It is immediately clear to the psychologist what cathartic and at the same rejuvenating effects must flow from the Demeter cult into the feminine psyche, and what a lack of psychic hygiene characterizes our culture, which no longer knows the kind of wholesome experience afforded by Eleusinian emotions.
I take full account of the fact that not only the psychologically minded layman but the professional psychologist and psychiatrist as well, and even the psychotherapist, do not possess an adequate knowledge of their patients' archetypal material, in so far as they have not specially investigated this aspect of the phenomenology of the unconsciousFor it is precisely in the field of psychiatric and psychotherapeutic observation that we frequently meet with cases characterized by a rich crop of archetypal symbolsSince the necessary historical knowledge is lacking to the physician observing them, he is not in a position to perceive the parallelism between his observations and the findings of anthropology and the humane sciences in generalConversely, an expert in mythology and comparative religion is as a rule no psychiatrist and consequently does not know that his mythologems are still fresh and living—for instance, in dreams and visions—in the hidden recesses of our most personal life, which we would on no account deliver up to scientific dissectionThe archetypal material is therefore the great unknown, and it requires special study and preparation even to collect such material.
It does not seem to me superfluous to give a number of examples from my case histories which bring out the occurrence of archetypal images in dreams or fantasiesTime and again with my public I come across the difficulty that they imagine illustration by a few examples to be the simplest thing in the worldIn actual fact it is almost impossible, with a few words and one or two images torn out of their context, to demonstrate anythingThis only works when dealing with an expertWhat Perseus has to do with the Gorgon's head would never occur to anyone who did not know the mythSo it is with the individual images: they need a context, and the context is not only a myth but an individual anamnesisSuch contexts, however, are of enormous extentAnything like a complete series of images would require for its proper presentation a book of about two hundred pagesMy own investigation of the Miller fantasies gives some idea of thisIt is therefore with the greatest hesitation that I make the attempt to illustrate from case-historiesThe material I shall use comes partly from normal, partly from slightly neurotic, personsIt is part dream, part vision, or dream mixed with visionThese visions are far from being hallucinations or ecstatic states; they are spontaneous, visual images of fantasy or so-called active imaginationThe latter is a method (devised by myself) of introspection for observing the stream of interior imagesOne concentrates one's attention on some impressive but unintelligible dream-image, or on a spontaneous visual impression, and observes the changes taking place in itMeanwhile, of course, all criticism must be suspended and the happenings observed and noted with absolute objectivityObviously, too, the objection that the whole thing is arbitrary or thought up must be set aside, since it springs from the anxiety of an ego-consciousness which brooks no master besides itself in its own houseIn other words, it is the inhibition exerted by the conscious mind on the unconscious.
Under these conditions, long and often very dramatic series of fantasies ensueThe advantage of this method is that it brings a mass of unconscious material to lightDrawing, painting, and modelling can be used to the same endOnce a visual series has become dramatic, it can easily pass over into the auditive or linguistic sphere and give rise to dialogues and the likeWith slightly pathological individuals, and particularly in the not infrequent cases of latent schizophrenia, the method may, in certain circumstances, prove to be rather dangerous and therefore requires medical controlIt is based on a deliberate weakening of the conscious mind and its inhibiting effect, which either limits or suppresses the unconsciousThe aim of the method is naturally therapeutic in the first place, while in the second it also furnishes rich empirical materialSome of our examples are taken from thisThey differ from dreams only by reason of their better form, which comes from the fact that the contents were perceived not by a dreaming but by a waking consciousnessThe examples are from women in middle life.
iI saw a white bird with outstretched wingsIt alighted on the figure of a woman, clad in blue, who sat there like an antique statueThe bird perched on her hand, and in it she held a grain of wheatThe bird took it in its beak and flew into the sky again.
For this X painted a picture: a blue-clad, archaically simple Mother-figure on a white marble baseHer maternity is emphasized by the large breasts.
iiA bull lifts a child up from the ground and carries it to the antique statue of a womanA naked young girl with a wreath of flowers in her hair appears, riding on a white bullShe takes the child and throws it into the air like a ball and catches it againThe white bull carries them both to a templeThe girl lays the child on the ground, and so on (initiation follows).
In this picture the maiden appears, rather in the form of Europa(Here a certain school knowledge is being made use of.) Her nakedness and the wreath of flowers point to Dionysian abandonmentThe game of ball with the child is the motif of some secret rite which always has to do with child-sacrifice. (Cfthe accusations of ritual murder levelled by the pagans against the Christians and by the Christians against the Jews and Gnostics; also the Phoenician child-sacrifices, rumours about the Black Mass, etc., and the ball-game in church.)
iiiI saw a golden pig on a pedestalBeast-like beings danced round it in a circleWe made haste to dig a hole in the groundI reached in and found waterThen a man appeared in a golden carriageHe jumped into the hole and began swaying back and forth, as if dancing…I swayed in rhythm with himThen he suddenly leaped out of the hole, raped me, and got me with child.
X is identical with the young girl, who often appears as a youth, tooThis youth is an animus-figure, the embodiment of the masculine element in a womanYouth and young girl together form a syzygy or coniunctio which symbolizes the essence of wholeness (as also does the Platonic hermaphrodite, who later became the symbol of perfected wholeness in alchemical philosophy)X evidently dances with the rest, hence we made haste. The parallel with the motifs stressed by Kerényi seems to me remarkable.
ivI saw a beautiful youth with golden cymbals, dancing and leaping in joy and abandonment…Finally he fell to the ground and buried his face in the flowersThen he sank into the lap of a very old motherAfter a time he got up and jumped into the water, where he sported like a dolphin…I saw that his hair was goldenNow we were leaping together, hand in handSo we came to a gorge…. In leaping the gorge the youth falls into the chasmX is left alone and comes to a river where a white sea-horse is waiting for her with a golden boat.
In this scene X is the youth; therefore he disappears later, leaving her the sole heroine of the storyShe is the child of the very old mother, and is also the dolphin, the youth lost in the gorge, and the bride evidently expected by PoseidonThe peculiar overlapping and displacement of motifs in all this individual material is about the same as in the mythological variantsX found the youth in the lap of the mother so impressive that she painted a picture of itThe figure is the same as in item i; only, instead of the grain of wheat in her hand, there is the body of the youth lying completely exhausted in the lap of the gigantic mother.
vThere now follows a sacrifice of sheep, during which a game of ball is likewise played with the sacrificial animalThe participants smear themselves with the sacrificial blood, and afterwards bathe in the pulsing goreX is thereupon transformed into a plant.
viAfter that X comes to a den of snakes, and the snakes wind all round her.
viiIn a den of snakes beneath the sea there is a divine woman, asleep(She is shown in the picture as much larger than the others.) She is wearing a blood-red garment that covers only the lower half of her bodyShe has a dark skin, full red lips, and seems to be of great physical strengthShe kisses X, who is obviously in the role of the young girl, and hands her as a present to the many men who are standing by, etc.
This chthonic goddess is the typical Earth Mother as she appears in so many modern fantasies.
viiiAs X emerged from the depths and saw the light again, she experienced a kind of illumination: white flames played about her head as she walked through waving fields of grain.
With this picture the Mother-episode endedAlthough there is not the slightest trace of any known myth being repeated, the motifs and the connections between them are all familiar to us from mythologyThese images present themselves spontaneously and are based on no conscious knowledge whateverI have applied the method of active imagination to myself over a long time and have observed numerous symbols and symbolic associations which in many cases I was only able to verify years afterwards in texts of whose existence I was totally ignorantIt is the same with dreamsSome years ago I dreamed for example that: I was climbing slowly and toilsomely up a mountainWhen I had reached, as I imagined, the top, I found that I was standing on the edge of a plateauThe crest that represented the real top of the mountain only rose far off in the distanceNight was coming on, and I saw, on the dark slope opposite, a brook flowing down with a metallic shimmer, and two paths leading upwards, one to the left, the other to the right, winding like serpentsOn the crest, to the right, there was a hotelDown below, the brook ran to the left with a bridge leading across.
Not long afterwards I discovered the following allegory in an obscure alchemical treatiseIn his Speculativae philosophiae the Frankfurt physician Gerard Dorn, who lived in the second half of the sixteenth century, describes the Mundi peregrinatio, quam erroris viam appellamus (Tour of the world, which we call the way of error) on the one hand and the Via veritatis on the otherOf the first way the author says:
The human race, whose nature it is to resist God, does not cease to ask how it may, by its own efforts, escape the pitfalls which it has laid for itselfBut it does not ask help from Him on whom alone depends every gift of mercyHence it has come about that men have built for themselves a great Workshop on the left-hand side of the road … presided over by IndustryAfter this has been attained, they turn aside from Industry and bend their steps towards the second region of the world, making their crossing on the bridge of infirmity…But because the good God desires to draw them backHe allows their infirmities to rule over them; then, seeking as before a remedy in themselves industry!, they flock to the great Hospital likewise built on the left, presided over by MedicineHere there is a great multitude of apothecaries, surgeons, and physicians, etc..
Of the way of truth, which is the right way, our author says: … you will come to the camp of Wisdom and on being received there, you will be refreshed with food far more powerful than before. Even the brook is there: … a stream of living water flowing with such wonderful artifice from the mountain peak(From the Fountain of Wisdom the waters gush forth.)
An important difference, compared with my dream, is that here, apart from the situation of the hotel being reversed, the river of Wisdom is on the right and not, as in my dream, in the middle of the picture.
It is evident that in my dream we are not dealing with any known myth but with a group of ideas which might easily have been regarded as individual, i.e., uniqueA thorough analysis, however, could show without difficulty that it is an archetypal image such as can be reproduced over and over again in any age and any placeBut I must admit that the archetypal nature of the dream-image only became clear to me when I read DornThese and similar incidents I have observed repeatedly not only in myself but in my patientsBut, as this example shows, it needs special attention if such parallels are not to be missed.
The antique Mother-image is not exhausted with the figure of DemeterIt also expresses itself in Cybele-ArtemisThe next case points in this direction.
I am wandering over a great mountain; the way is lonely, wild, and difficultA woman comes down from the sky to accompany and help meShe is all bright with light hair and shining eyesNow and then she vanishesAfter going on for some time alone I notice that I have left my stick somewhere, and must turn back to fetch itTo do this I have to pass a terrible monster, an enormous bearWhen I came this way the first time I had to pass it, but then the sky-woman protected meJust as I am passing the beast and he is about to come at me, she stands beside me again, and at her look the bear lies down quietly and lets us passThen the sky-woman vanishes.
Here we have a maternally protective goddess related to bears, a kind of Diana or the Gallo-Roman Dea ArtioThe sky-woman is the positive, the bear the negative aspect of the supraordinate personality, which extends the conscious human being upwards into the celestial and downwards into the animal regions.
We go through a door into a tower-like room, where we climb a long flight of stepsOn one of the topmost steps I read an inscription: Vis ut sis.' The steps end in a temple situated on the crest of a wooded mountain, and there is no other approachIt is the shrine of Ursanna, the bear-goddess and Mother of God in oneThe temple is of red stoneBloody sacrifices are offered thereAnimals are standing about the altarIn order to enter the temple precincts one has to be transformed into an animal—a beast of the forestThe temple has the form of a cross with equal arms and a circular space in the middle, which is not roofed, so that one can look straight up at the sky and the constellation of the BearOn the altar in the middle of the open space there stands the moon-bowl, from which smoke or vapour continually risesThere is also a huge image of the goddess, but it cannot be seen clearlyThe worshippers, who have been changed into animals and to whom I also belong, have to touch the goddess's foot with their own foot, whereupon the image gives them a sign or an oracular utterance like Vis ut sis.'
In this dream the bear-goddess emerges plainly, although her statue cannot be seen clearly. The relationship to the self, the supraordinate personality, is indicated not only by the oracle Vis ut sis but by the quaternity and the circular central precinct of the templeFrom ancient times any relationship to the stars has always symbolized eternityThe soul comes from the stars and returns to the stellar regionsUrsanna's relation to the moon is indicated by the moon-bowl.
The moon-goddess also appears in children's dreamsA girl who grew up in peculiarly difficult psychic circumstances had a recurrent dream between her seventh and tenth years: The moon-lady was always waiting for me down by the water at the landing-stage, to take me to her island. Unfortunately she could never remember what happened there, but it was so beautiful that she often prayed she might have this dream againAlthough, as is evident, the two dreamers are not identical, the island motif also occurred in the previous dream as the inaccessible mountain crest.
I am climbing a steep dark mountain, on top of which stands a domed castleI enter and go up a winding stairway to the leftArriving inside the dome, I find myself in the presence of a woman wearing a head-dress of cow's hornsI recognize her immediately as the moon-lady of my childhood dreamsAt her behest I look to the right and see a dazzlingly bright sun shining on the other side of a deep chasmOver the chasm stretches a narrow, transparent bridge, upon which I step, conscious of the fact that in no circumstances must I look downAn uncanny fear seizes me, and I hesitateTreachery seems to be in the air, but at last I go across and stand before the sunThe sun speaks: If you can approach me nine times without being burned, all will be well.' But I grow more and more afraid, finally I do look down, and I see a black tentacle like that of an octopus groping towards me from underneath the sunI step back in fright and plunge into the abyssBut instead of being dashed to pieces I lie in the arms of the Earth MotherWhen I try to look into her face, she turns to clay, and I find myself lying on the earth.
It is remarkable how the beginning of this fantasy agrees with the dreamThe moon-lady above is clearly distinguished from the Earth Mother belowThe former urges the dreamer to her somewhat perilous adventure with the sun; the latter catches her protectively in her maternal armsThe dreamer, as the one in danger, would therefore seem to be in the role of the Kore.
Y sees two pictures in a dream, painted by the Scandinavian painter Hermann Christian Lund.
The first picture is of a Scandinavian peasant roomPeasant girls in gay costumes are walking about arm in arm (that is, in a row)The middle one is smaller than the rest and, besides this, has a hump and keeps turning her head backThis, together with her peculiar glance, gives her a witchlike look.
The second picture shows a dragon with its neck stretched out over the whole picture and especially over a girl, who is in the dragon's power and cannot move, for as soon as she moves, the dragon, which can make its body big or little at will, moves too; and when the girl wants to get away it simply stretches out its neck over her, and so catches her againStrangely enough, the girl has no face, at least I couldn't see it.
The painter is an invention of the dreamThe animus often appears as a painter or has some kind of projection apparatus, or is a cinema-operator or owner of a picture-galleryAll this refers to the animus as the function mediating between conscious and unconscious: the unconscious contains pictures which are transmitted, that is, made manifest, by the animus, either as fantasies or, unconsciously, in the patient's own life and actionsThe animus-projection gives rise to fantasied relations of love and hatred for heroes or demons. The favourite victims are tenors, artists, movie-stars, athletic champions, etcIn the first picture the maiden is characterized as demonic, with a hump and an evil look over her shoulder. (Hence amulets against the evil eye are often worn by primitives on the nape of the neck, for the vulnerable spot is at the back, where you can't see.)
In the second picture the maiden is portrayed as the innocent victim of the monsterJust as before there was a relationship of identity between the sky-woman and the bear, so here between the young girl and the dragon—which in practical life is often rather more than just a bad jokeHere it signifies a widening of the conscious personality, i.e., through the helplessness of the victim on the one hand and the dangers of the humpback's evil eye and the dragon's might on the other.
iv (part dream, part visual imagination)A magician is demonstrating his tricks to an Indian princeHe produces a beautiful young girl from under a clothShe is a dancer, who has the power to change her shape or at least hold her audience spell-bound by faultless illusionDuring the dance she dissolves with the music into a swarm of beesThen she changes into a leopard, then into a jet of water, then into an octopus that has twined itself about a young pearl-fisherBetween times, she takes human form again at the dramatic momentShe appears as a she-ass bearing two baskets of wonderful fruitsThen she becomes a many-coloured peacockThe prince is beside himself with delight and calls her to himBut she dances on, now naked, and even tears the skin from her body, and finally falls down—a naked skeletonThis is buried, but at night a lily grows out of the grave, and from its cup there rises a white lady, who floats slowly up to the sky.
This piece describes the successive transformations of the illusionist (artistry in illusion being a specifically feminine talent) until she becomes a transfigured personalityThe fantasy was not invented as a sort of allegory; it was part dream, part spontaneous imagery.
I am in a church made of grey sandstoneThe apse is built rather highNear the tabernacle a girl in a red dress is hanging on the stone cross of the window(Suicide?)
Just as in the preceding cases the sacrifice of a child or a sheep played a part, so here the sacrifice of the maiden hanging on the cross. The death of the dancer is also to be understood in this sense, for these maidens are always doomed to die, because their exclusive domination of the feminine psyche hinders the individuation process, that is, the maturation of personalityThe maiden corresponds to the anima of the man and makes use of it to gain her natural ends, in which illusion plays the greatest role imaginableBut as long as a woman is content to be a femme à homme, she has no feminine individualityShe is empty and merely glitters—a welcome vessel for masculine projectionsWoman as a personality, however, is a very different thing: here illusion no longer worksSo that when the question of personality arises, which is as a rule the painful fact of the second half of life, the childish form of the self disappears too.
All that remains for me now is to describe the Kore as observable in man, the animaSince a man's wholeness, in so far as he is not constitutionally homosexual, can only be a masculine personality, the feminine figure of the anima cannot be catalogued as a type of supraordinate personality but requires a different evaluation and positionIn the products of unconscious activity, the anima appears equally as maiden and mother, which is why a personalistic interpretation always reduces her to the personal mother or some other female personThe real meaning of the figure naturally gets lost in the process, as is inevitably the case with all these reductive interpretations whether in the sphere of the psychology of the unconscious or of mythologyThe innumerable attempts that have been made in the sphere of mythology to interpret gods and heroes in a solar, lunar, astral, or meteorological sense contribute nothing of importance to the understanding of them; on the contrary, they all put us on a false trackWhen, therefore, in dreams and other spontaneous products, we meet with an unknown female figure whose significance oscillates between the extremes of goddess and whore, it is advisable to let her keep her independence and not reduce her arbitrarily to something knownIf the unconscious shows her as an unknown, this attribute should not be got rid of by main force with a view to arriving at a rational interpretationLike the supraordinate personality, the anima is bipolar and can therefore appear positive one moment and negative the next; now young, now old; now mother, now maiden; now a good fairy, now a witch; now a saint, now a whoreBesides this ambivalence, the anima also has occult connections with mysteries, with the world of darkness in general, and for that reason she often has a religious tingeWhenever she emerges with some degree of clarity, she always has a peculiar relationship to time: as a rule she is more or less immortal, because outside timeWriters who have tried their hand at this figure have never failed to stress the anima's peculiarity in this respectI would refer to the classic descriptions in Rider Haggard's She and The Return of She, in Pierre Benoît's L'Atlantide, and above all in the novel of the young American author, William MSloane, To Walk the NightIn all these accounts, the anima is outside time as we know it and consequently immensely old or a being who belongs to a different order of things.
Since we can no longer or only partially express the archetypes of the unconscious by means of figures in which we religiously believe, they lapse into unconsciousness again and hence are unconsciously projected upon more or less suitable human personalitiesTo the young boy a clearly discernible anima-form appears in his mother, and this lends her the radiance of power and superiority or else a daemonic aura of even greater fascinationBut because of the anima's ambivalence, the projection can be entirely negativeMuch of the fear which the female sex arouses in men is due to the projection of the anima-imageAn infantile man generally has a maternal anima; an adult man, the figure of a younger womanThe senile man finds compensation in a very young girl, or even a child.
The anima also has affinities with animals, which symbolize her characteristicsThus she can appear as a snake or a tiger or a birdI quote by way of example a dream-series that contains transformations of this kind:
A white bird perches on a tableSuddenly it changes into a fair-haired seven-year-old girl and just as suddenly back into a bird, which now speaks with a human voice.
In an underground house, which is really the underworld, there lives an old magician and prophet with his daughter. She is, however, not really his daughter; she is a dancer, a very loose person, but is blind and seeks healing.
A lonely house in a wood, where an old scholar is livingSuddenly his daughter appears, a kind of ghost, complaining that people only look upon her as a figment of fancy.
On the façade of a church there is a Gothic Madonna, who is alive and is the unknown and yet known woman. Instead of a child, she holds in her arms a sort of flame or a snake or a dragon.
A black-clad countess kneels in a dark chapelHer dress is hung with costly pearlsShe has red hair, and there is something uncanny about herMoreover, she is surrounded by the spirits of the dead.
A female snake comports herself tenderly and insinuatingly, speaking with a human voiceShe is only accidentally shaped like a snake.
A bird speaks with the same voice, but shows herself helpful by trying to rescue the dreamer from a dangerous situation.
The unknown woman sits, like the dreamer, on the tip of a church-spire and stares at him uncannily across the abyss.
The unknown woman suddenly appears as an old female attendant in an underground public lavatory with a temperature of ° below zero.
The unknown woman leaves the house as a petite bourgeoise with a female relation, and in her place there is suddenly an over-life-size goddess clad in blue, looking like Athene.
Then she appears in a church, taking the place of the altar, still over-life-size but with veiled face.
In all these dreams the central figure is a mysterious feminine being with qualities like those of no woman known to the dreamerThe unknown is described as such in the dreams themselves, and reveals her extraordinary nature firstly by her power to change shape and secondly by her paradoxical ambivalenceEvery conceivable shade of meaning glitters in her, from the highest to the lowest.
Dream i shows the anima as elflike, i.e., only partially humanShe can just as well be a bird, which means that she may belong wholly to nature and can vanish (i.e., become unconscious) from the human sphere (i.e., consciousness).
Dream ii shows the unknown woman as a mythological figure from the beyond (the unconscious)She is the soror or filia mystica of a hierophant or philosopher, evidently a parallel to those mystic syzygies which are to be met with in the figures of Simon Magus and Helen, Zosimus and Theosebeia, Comarius and Cleopatra, etcOur dream-figure fits in best with HelenA really admirable description of anima-psychology in a woman is to be found in Erskine's Helen of Troy.
Dream iii presents the same theme, but on a more fairytale-like planeHere the anima is shown as rather spookish.
Dream iv brings the anima nearer to the Mother of GodThe child refers to the mystic speculations on the subject of the redemptive serpent and the fiery nature of the redeemer.
In dream v, the anima is visualized somewhat romantically as the distinguished fascinating woman, who nevertheless has dealings with spirits.
Dreams vi and vii bring theriomorphic variationsThe anima's identity is at once apparent to the dreamer because of the voice and what it saysThe anima has accidentally taken the form of a snake, just as in dream i she changed with the greatest ease into a bird and back againAs a snake, she is playing the negative role, as a bird the positive.
Dream viii shows the dreamer confronted with his animaThis takes place high above the ground (i.e., above human reality)Obviously it is a case of dangerous fascination by the anima.
Dream ix signifies the anima's deep plunge into an extremely subordinate position, where the last trace of fascination has gone and only human sympathy is left.
Dream x shows the paradoxical double nature of the anima: banal mediocrity and Olympian divinity.
Dream xi restores the anima to the Christian church, not as an icon but as the altar itselfThe altar is the place of sacrifice and also the receptacle for consecrated relics.
To throw even a moderate light on all these anima associations would require special and very extensive investigation, which would be out of place here because, as we have already said, the anima has only an indirect bearing on the interpretation of the Kore figureI have presented this dream-series simply for the purpose of giving the reader some idea of the empirical material on which the idea of the anima is basedFrom this series and others like it we get an average picture of that strange factor which has such an important part to play in the masculine psyche, and which naïve presumption invariably identifies with certain women, imputing to them all the illusions that swarm in the male Eros.
It seems clear enough that the man's anima found occasion for projection in the Demeter cultThe Kore doomed to her subterranean fate, the two-faced mother, and the theriomorphic aspects of both afforded the anima ample opportunity to reflect herself, shimmering and equivocal, in the Eleusinian cult, or rather to experience herself there and fill the celebrants with her unearthly essence, to their lasting gainFor a man, anima experiences are always of immense and abiding significance.
But the Demeter-Kore myth is far too feminine to have been merely the result of an anima-projectionAlthough the anima can, as we have said, experience herself in Demeter-Kore, she is yet of a wholly different natureShe is in the highest degree femme à homme, whereas Demeter-Kore exists on the plane of mother-daughter experience, which is alien to man and shuts him outIn fact, the psychology of the Demeter cult bears all the features of a matriarchal order of society, where the man is an indispensable but on the whole disturbing factor.
One of the unbreakable rules in scientific research is to take an object as known only so far as the inquirer is in a position to make scientifically valid statements about itValid in this sense simply means what can be verified by factsThe object of inquiry is the natural phenomenonNow in psychology, one of the most important phenomena is the statement, and in particular its form and content, the latter aspect being perhaps the more significant with regard to the nature of the psycheThe first task that ordinarily presents itself is the description and arrangement of events, then comes the closer examination into the laws of their living behaviourTo inquire into the substance of what has been observed is possible in natural science only where there is an Archimedean point outsideFor the psyche, no such outside standpoint exists—only the psyche can observe the psycheConsequently, knowledge of the psychic substance is impossible for us, at least with the means at present availableThis does not rule out the possibility that the atomic physics of the future may supply us with the said Archimedean pointFor the time being, however, our subtlest lucubrations can establish no more than is expressed in the statement: this is how the psyche behavesThe honest investigator will piously refrain from meddling with questions of substanceI do not think it superfluous to acquaint my reader with the necessary limitations that psychology voluntarily imposes on itself, for he will then be in a position to appreciate the phenomenological standpoint of modern psychology, which is not always understoodThis standpoint does not exclude the existence of faith, conviction, and experienced certainties of whatever description, nor does it contest their possible validityGreat as is their importance for the individual and for collective life, psychology completely lacks the means to prove their validity in the scientific senseOne may lament this incapacity on the part of science, but that does not enable it to jump over its own shadow.
The word spirit possesses such a wide range of application that it requires considerable effort to make clear to oneself all the things it can meanSpirit, we say, is the principle that stands in opposition to matterBy this we understand an immaterial substance or form of existence which on the highest and most universal level is called God. We imagine this immaterial substance also as the vehicle of psychic phenomena or even of life itselfIn contradiction to this view there stands the antithesis: spirit and natureHere the concept of spirit is restricted to the supernatural or anti-natural, and has lost its substantial connection with psyche and lifeA similar restriction is implied in Spinoza's view that spirit is an attribute of the One SubstanceHylozoism goes even further, taking spirit to be a quality of matter.
A very widespread view conceives spirit as a higher and psyche as a lower principle of activity, and conversely the alchemists thought of spirit as the ligamentum animae et corporis, obviously regarding it as a spiritus vegetativus (the later life-spirit or nerve-spirit)Equally common is the view that spirit and psyche are essentially the same and can be separated only arbitrarilyWundt takes spirit as the inner being, regardless of any connection with an outer being. Others restrict spirit to certain psychic capacities or functions or qualities, such as the capacity to think and reason in contradistinction to the more soulful sentimentsHere spirit means the sum-total of all the phenomena of rational thought, or of the intellect, including the will, memory, imagination, creative power, and aspirations motivated by idealsSpirit has the further connotation of sprightliness, as when we say that a person is spirited, meaning that he is versatile and full of ideas, with a brilliant, witty, and surprising turn of mindAgain, spirit denotes a certain attitude or the principle underlying it, for instance, one is educated in the spirit of Pestalozzi, or one says that the spirit of Weimar is the immortal German heritage. A special instance is the time-spirit, or spirit of the age, which stands for the principle and motive force behind certain views, judgments, and actions of a collective natureThen there is the objective spirit, by which is meant the whole stock of man's cultural possessions with particular regard to his intellectual and religious achievements.
As linguistic usage shows, spirit in the sense of an attitude has unmistakable leanings towards personification: the spirit of Pestalozzi can also be taken concretistically as his ghost or imago, just as the spirits of Weimar are the personal spectres of Goethe and Schiller; for spirit still has the spookish meaning of the soul of one departedThe cold breath of the spirits points on the one hand to the ancient affinity of ψυχή with ψυχóς and ψūχος, which both mean cold,' and on the other hand to the original meaning of πνεūμα, which simply denoted air in motion'; and in the same way animus and anima were connected with áνεμος, wind.' The German word Geist probably has more to do with something frothing, effervescing, or fermenting; hence affinities with Gischt (foam), Gäscht (yeast), ghost, and also with the emotional ghastly and aghast, are not to be rejectedFrom time immemorial emotion has been regarded as possession, which is why we still say today, of a hot-tempered person, that he is possessed of a devil or that an evil spirit has entered into himJust as, according to the old view, the spirits or souls of the dead are of a subtle disposition like a vapour or a smoke, so to the alchemist spiritus was a subtle, volatile, active, and vivifying essence, such as alcohol was understood to be, and all the arcane substancesOn this level, spirit includes spirits of salts, spirits of ammonia, formic spirit, etc.
This score or so of meanings and shades of meaning attributable to the word spirit make it difficult for the psychologist to delimit his subject conceptually, but on the other hand they lighten the task of describing it, since the many different aspects go to form a vivid and concrete picture of the phenomenon in questionWe are concerned with a functional complex which originally, on the primitive level, was felt as an invisible, breathlike presence. William James has given us a lively account of this primordial phenomenon in his Varieties of Religious ExperienceAnother well-known example is the wind of the Pentecostal miracleThe primitive mentality finds it quite natural to personify the invisible presence as a ghost or demonThe souls or spirits of the dead are identical with the psychic activity of the living; they merely continue itThe view that the psyche is a spirit is implicit in thisWhen therefore something psychic happens in the individual which he feels as belonging to himself, that something is his own spiritBut if anything psychic happens which seems to him strange, then it is somebody else's spirit, and it may be causing a possessionThe spirit in the first case corresponds to the subjective attitude, in the latter case to public opinion, to the time-spirit, or to the original, not yet human, anthropoid disposition which we also call the unconscious.
In keeping with its original wind-nature, spirit is always an active, winged, swift-moving being as well as that which vivifies, stimulates, incites, fires, and inspiresTo put it in modern language, spirit is the dynamic principle, forming for that very reason the classical antithesis of matter—the antithesis, that is, of its stasis and inertiaBasically it is the contrast between life and death The subsequent differentiation of this contrast leads to the actually very remarkable opposition of spirit and natureEven though spirit is regarded as essentially alive and enlivening, one cannot really feel nature as unspiritual and deadWe must therefore be dealing here with the (Christian) postulate of a spirit whose life is so vastly superior to the life of nature that in comparison with it the latter is no better than death.
This special development in man's idea of spirit rests on the recognition that its invisible presence is a psychic phenomenon, i.e., one's own spirit, and that this consists not only of uprushes of life but of formal products tooAmong the first, the most prominent are the images and shadowy presentations that occupy our inner field of vision; among the second, thinking and reason, which organize the world of imagesIn this way a transcendent spirit superimposed itself upon the original, natural life-spirit and even swung over to the opposite position, as though the latter were merely naturalisticThe transcendent spirit became the supranatural and transmundane cosmic principle of order and as such was given the name of God, or at least it became an attribute of the One Substance (as in Spinoza) or one Person of the Godhead (as in Christianity).
The corresponding development of spirit in the reverse, hylozoistic direction—a maiori ad minus—took place under anti-Christian auspices in materialismThe premise underlying this reaction is the exclusive certainty of the spirit's identity with psychic functions, whose dependence upon brain and metabolism became increasingly clearOne had only to give the One Substance another name and call it matter to produce the idea of a spirit which was entirely dependent on nutrition and environment, and whose highest form was the intellect or reasonThis meant that the original pneumatic presence had taken up its abode in man's physiology, and a writer like Klages could arraign the spirit as the adversary of the soul. For it was into this latter concept that the original spontaneity of the spirit withdrew after it had been degraded to a servile attribute of matterSomewhere or other the deus ex machina quality of spirit had to be preserved—if not in the spirit itself, then in its synonym the soul, that glancing, Aeolian thing, elusive as a butterfly (anima, ψυχή).
Even though the materialistic conception of the spirit did not prevail everywhere, it still persisted, outside the sphere of religion, in the realm of conscious phenomenaSpirit as subjective spirit came to mean a purely endopsychic phenomenon, while objective spirit did not mean the universal spirit, or God, but merely the sum total of intellectual and cultural possessions which make up our human institutions and the content of our librariesSpirit had forfeited its original nature, its autonomy and spontaneity over a very wide area, with the solitary exception of the religious field, where, at least in principle, its pristine character remained unimpaired.
In this résumé we have described an entity which presents itself to us as an immediate psychic phenomenon distinguished from other psychisms whose existence is naïvely believed to be causally dependent upon physical influencesA connection between spirit and physical conditions is not immediately apparent, and for this reason it was credited with immateriality to a much higher degree than was the case with psychic phenomena in the narrower senseNot only is a certain physical dependence attributed to the latter, but they are themselves thought of as possessing a kind of materiality, as the idea of the subtle body and the Chinese kuei-soul clearly showIn view of the intimate connection that exists between certain psychic processes and their physical parallels we cannot very well accept the total immateriality of the psycheAs against this, the consensus omnium insists on the immateriality of spirit, though not everyone would agree that it also has a reality of its ownIt is, however, not easy to see why our hypothetical matter, which looks quite different from what it did even thirty years ago, alone should be real, and spirit notAlthough the idea of immateriality does not in itself exclude that of reality, popular opinion invariably associates reality with materialitySpirit and matter may well be forms of one and the same transcendental beingFor instance the Tantrists, with as much right, say that matter is nothing other than the concreteness of God's thoughtsThe sole immediate reality is the psychic reality of conscious contents, which are as it were labelled with a spiritual or material origin as the case may be.
The hallmarks of spirit are, firstly, the principle of spontaneous movement and activity; secondly, the spontaneous capacity to produce images independently of sense perception; and thirdly, the autonomous and sovereign manipulation of these imagesThis spiritual entity approaches primitive man from outside; but with increasing development it gets lodged in man's consciousness and becomes a subordinate function, thus apparently forfeiting its original character of autonomyThat character is now retained only in the most conservative views, namely in the religionsThe descent of spirit into the sphere of human consciousness is expressed in the myth of the divine νοūς caught in the embrace of ϕúσιςThis process, continuing over the ages, is probably an unavoidable necessity, and the religions would find themselves in a very forlorn situation if they believed in the attempt to hold up evolutionTheir task, if they are well advised, is not to impede the ineluctable march of events, but to guide it in such a way that it can proceed without fatal injury to the soulThe religions should therefore constantly recall to us the origin and original character of the spirit, lest man should forget what he is drawing into himself and with what he is filling his consciousnessHe himself did not create the spirit, rather the spirit makes him creative, always spurring him on, giving him lucky ideas, staying power, enthusiasm and inspiration. So much, indeed, does it permeate his whole being that he is in gravest danger of thinking that he actually created the spirit and that he has itIn reality, however, the primordial phenomenon of the spirit takes possession of him, and, while appearing to be the willing object of human intentions, it binds his freedom, just as the physical world does, with a thousand chains and becomes an obsessive idée-forceSpirit threatens the naïve-minded man with inflation, of which our own times have given us the most horribly instructive examplesThe danger becomes all the greater the more our interest fastens upon external objects and the more we forget that the differentiation of our relation to nature should go hand in hand with a correspondingly differentiated relation to the spirit, so as to establish the necessary balanceIf the outer object is not offset by an inner, unbridled materialism results, coupled with maniacal arrogance or else the extinction of the autonomous personality, which is in any case the ideal of the totalitarian mass state.
As can readily be seen, the common modern idea of spirit ill accords with the Christian view, which regards it as the sum-mum bonum, as God himselfTo be sure, there is also the idea of an evil spiritBut the modern idea cannot be equated with that either, since for us spirit is not necessarily evil; we would have to call it morally indifferent or neutralWhen the Bible says God is spirit, it sounds more like the definition of a substance, or like a qualificationBut the devil too, it seems, is endowed with the same peculiar spiritual substance, albeit an evil and corrupt oneThe original identity of substance is still expressed in the idea of the fallen angel, as well as in the close connection between Jehovah and Satan in the Old TestamentThere may be an echo of this primitive connection in the Lord's Prayer, where we say Lead us not into temptation—for is not this really the business of the tempter, the devil himself?
This brings us to a point we have not considered at all in the course of our observations so farWe have availed ourselves of cultural and everyday conceptions which are the product of human consciousness and its reflections, in order to form a picture of the psychic modes of manifestation of the factor spirit. But we have yet to consider that because of its original autonomy, about which there can be no doubt in the psychological sense, the spirit is quite capable of staging its own manifestations spontaneously.
The psychic manifestations of the spirit indicate at once that they are of an archetypal nature—in other words, the phenomenon we call spirit depends on the existence of an autonomous primordial image which is universally present in the preconscious makeup of the human psycheAs usual, I first came up against this problem when investigating the dreams of my patientsIt struck me that a certain kind of father-complex has a spiritual character, so to speak, in the sense that the father-image gives rise to statements, actions, tendencies, impulses, opinions, etc., to which one could hardly deny the attribute spiritual. In men, a positive father-complex very often produces a certain credulity with regard to authority and a distinct willingness to bow down before all spiritual dogmas and values; while in women, it induces the liveliest spiritual aspirations and interestsIn dreams, it is always the father-figure from whom the decisive convictions, prohibitions, and wise counsels emanateThe invisibility of this source is frequently emphasized by the fact that it consists simply of an authoritative voice which passes final judgmentsMostly, therefore, it is the figure of a wise old man who symbolizes the spiritual factorSometimes the part is played by a real spirit, namely the ghost of one dead, or, more rarely, by grotesque gnomelike figures or talking animalsThe dwarf forms are found, at least in my experience, mainly in women; hence it seems to me logical that in Ernst Barlach's play Der tote Tag (), the gnomelike figure of Steissbart (Rumpbeard) is associated with the mother, just as Bes is associated with the mother-goddess at KarnakIn both sexes the spirit can also take the form of a boy or a youthIn women he corresponds to the so-called positive animus who indicates the possibility of conscious spiritual effortIn men his meaning is not so simpleHe can be positive, in which case he signifies the higher personality, the self or filius regius as conceived by the alchemistsBut he can also be negative, and then he signifies the infantile shadowIn both cases the boy means some form of spiritGraybeard and boy belong togetherThe pair of them play a considerable role in alchemy as symbols of Mercurius.
It can never be established with one-hundred-per-cent certainty whether the spirit-figures in dreams are morally goodVery often they show all the signs of duplicity, if not of outright maliceI must emphasize, however, that the grand plan on which the unconscious life of the psyche is constructed is so inaccessible to our understanding that we can never know what evil may not be necessary in order to produce good by enantiodromia, and what good may very possibly lead to evilSometimes the probate spiritus recommended by John cannot, with the best will in the world, be anything other than a cautious and patient waiting to see how things will finally turn out.
The figure of the wise old man can appear so plastically, not only in dreams but also in visionary meditation (or what we call active imagination), that, as is sometimes apparently the case in India, it takes over the role of a guruThe wise old man appears in dreams in the guise of a magician, doctor, priest, teacher, professor, grandfather, or any other person possessing authorityThe archetype of spirit in the shape of a man, hobgoblin, or animal always appears in a situation where insight, understanding, good advice, determination, planning, etc., are needed but cannot be mustered on one's own resourcesThe archetype compensates this state of spiritual deficiency by contents designed to fill the gapAn excellent example of this is the dream about the white and black magicians, which tried to compensate the spiritual difficulties of a young theological studentI did not know the dreamer myself, so the question of my personal influence is ruled outHe dreamed he was standing in the presence of a sublime hieratic figure called the white magician, who was nevertheless clothed in a long black robeThis magician had just ended a lengthy discourse with the words And for that we require the help of the black magician. Then the door suddenly opened and another old man came in, the black magician, who however was dressed in a white robeHe too looked noble and sublimeThe black magician evidently wanted to speak with the white, but hesitated to do so in the presence of the dreamerAt that the white magician, pointing to the dreamer, said, Speak, he is an innocent. So the black magician began to relate a strange story of how he had found the lost keys of Paradise and did not know how to use themHe had, he said, come to the white magician for an explanation of the secret of the keysHe told him that the king of the country in which he lived was seeking a suitable tomb for himselfHis subjects had chanced to dig up an old sarcophagus containing the mortal remains of a virginThe king opened the sarcophagus, threw away the bones, and had the empty sarcophagus buried again for later useBut no sooner had the bones seen the light of day than the being to whom they once had belonged—the virgin—changed into a black horse that galloped off into the desertThe black magician pursued it across the sandy wastes and beyond, and there after many vicissitudes and difficulties he found the lost keys of ParadiseThat was the end of his story, and also, unfortunately, of the dream.
Here the compensation certainly did not fall out as the dreamer would wish, by handing him a solution on a plate; rather it confronted him with a problem to which I have already alluded, and one which life is always bringing us up against: namely, the uncertainty of all moral valuation, the bewildering interplay of good and evil, and the remorseless concatenation of guilt, suffering, and redemptionThis path to the primordial religious experience is the right one, but how many can recognize it? It is like a still small voice, and it sounds from afarIt is ambiguous, questionable, dark, presaging danger and hazardous adventure; a razor-edged path, to be trodden for God's sake only, without assurance and without sanction.
I would gladly present the reader with some more modern dream-material, but I fear that the individualism of dreams would make too high a demand upon our exposition and would claim more space than is here at our disposalWe shall therefore turn to folklore, where we need not get involved in the grim confrontations and entanglements of individual case histories and can observe the variations of the spirit motif without having to consider conditions that are more or less uniqueIn myths and fairytales, as in dreams, the psyche tells its own story, and the interplay of the archetypes is revealed in its natural setting as formation, transformation / the eternal Mind's eternal recreation.
The frequency with which the spirit-type appears as an old man is about the same in fairytales as in dreamsThe old man always appears when the hero is in a hopeless and desperate situation from which only profound reflection or a lucky idea—in other words, a spiritual function or an endopsychic automatism of some kind—can extricate himBut since, for internal and external reasons, the hero cannot accomplish this himself, the knowledge needed to compensate the deficiency comes in the form of a personified thought, i.e., in the shape of this sagacious and helpful old manAn Estonian fairytale, for instance, tells how an ill-treated little orphan boy who had let a cow escape was afraid to return home again for fear of more punishmentSo he ran away, chancing to luckHe naturally got himself into a hopeless situation, with no visible way outExhausted, he fell into a deep sleepWhen he awoke, it seemed to him that he had something liquid in his mouth, and he saw a little old man with a long grey beard standing before him, who was in the act of replacing the stopper in his little milk-flaskGive me some more to drink,' begged the boyYou have had enough for today,' replied the old manIf my path had not chanced to lead me to you, that would assuredly have been your last sleep, for when I found you, you were half dead.' Then the old man asked the boy who he was and where he wanted to goThe boy recounted everything he could remember happening to him up to the beating he had received the previous eveningMy dear child,' said the old man, you are no better and no worse off than many others whose dear protectors and comforters rest in their coffins under the earthYou can no longer turn backNow that you have run away, you must seek a new fortune in the worldAs I have neither house nor home, nor wife nor child, I cannot take further care of you, but I will give you some good advice for nothing.'
So far the old man has been expressing no more than what the boy, the hero of the tale, could have thought out for himselfHaving given way to the stress of emotion and simply run off like that into the blue, he would at least have had to reflect that he needed foodIt would also have been necessary, at such a moment, to consider his positionThe whole story of his life up to the recent past would then have passed before his mind, as is usual in such casesAn anamnesis of this kind is a purposeful process whose aim is to gather the assets of the whole personality together at the critical moment, when all one's spiritual and physical forces are challenged, and with this united strength to fling open the door of the futureNo one can help the boy to do this; he has to rely entirely on himselfThere is no going backThis realization will give the necessary resolution to his actionsBy forcing him to face the issue, the old man saves him the trouble of making up his mindIndeed the old man is himself this purposeful reflection and concentration of moral and physical forces that comes about spontaneously in the psychic space outside consciousness when conscious thought is not yet—or is no longer—possibleThe concentration and tension of psychic forces have something about them that always looks like magic: they develop an unexpected power of endurance which is often superior to the conscious effort of willOne can observe this experimentally in the artificial concentration induced by hypnosis: in my demonstrations I used regularly to put an hysteric, of weak bodily build, into a deep hypnotic sleep and then get her to lie with the back of her head on one chair and her heels resting on another, stiff as a board, and leave her there for about a minuteHer pulse would gradually go up to A husky young athlete among the students tried in vain to imitate this feat with a conscious effort of willHe collapsed in the middle with his pulse racing at .
When the clever old man had brought the boy to this point he could begin his good advice, i.e., the situation no longer looked hopelessHe advised him to continue his wanderings, always to the eastward, where after seven years he would reach the great mountain that betokened his good fortuneThe bigness and tallness of the mountain are allusions to his adult personalityConcentration of his powers brings assurance and is therefore the best guarantee of successFrom now on he will lack for nothingTake my scrip and my flask, says the old man, and each day you will find in them all the food and drink you need. At the same time he gave him a burdock leaf that could change into a boat whenever the boy had to cross water.
Often the old man in fairytales asks questions like who? why? whence? and whither? for the purpose of inducing self-reflection and mobilizing the moral forces, and more often still he gives the necessary magical talisman, the unexpected and improbable power to succeed, which is one of the peculiarities of the unified personality in good or bad alikeBut the intervention of the old man—the spontaneous objectivation of the archetype—would seem to be equally indispensable, since the conscious will by itself is hardly ever capable of uniting the personality to the point where it acquires this extraordinary power to succeedFor that, not only in fairytales but in life generally, the objective intervention of the archetype is needed, which checks the purely affective reactions with a chain of inner confrontations and realizationsThese cause the who? where? how? why? to emerge clearly and in this wise bring knowledge of the immediate situation as well as of the goalThe resultant enlightenment and untying of the fatal tangle often has something positively magical about it—an experience not unknown to the psychotherapist.
The tendency of the old man to set one thinking also takes the form of urging people to sleep on it. Thus he says to the girl who is searching for her lost brothers: Lie down: morning is cleverer than evening. He also sees through the gloomy situation of the hero who has got himself into trouble, or at least can give him such information as will help him on his journeyTo this end he makes ready use of animals, particularly birdsTo the prince who has gone in search of the kingdom of heaven the old hermit says: I have lived here for three hundred years, but never yet has anybody asked me about the kingdom of heavenI cannot tell you myself; but up there, on another floor of the house, live all kinds of birds, and they can surely tell you. The old man knows what roads lead to the goal and points them out to the heroHe warns of dangers to come and supplies the means of meeting them effectivelyFor instance, he tells the boy who has gone to fetch the silver water that the well is guarded by a lion who has the deceptive trick of sleeping with his eyes open and watching with his eyes shut; or he counsels the youth who is riding to a magic fountain in order to fetch the healing draught for the king, only to draw the water at a trot because of the lurking witches who lasso everybody that comes to the fountainHe charges the princess whose lover has been changed into a werewolf to make a fire and put a cauldron of tar over itThen she must plunge her beloved white lily into the boiling tar, and when the werewolf comes, she must empty the cauldron over its head, which will release her lover from the spellOccasionally the old man is a very critical old man, as in the Caucasian tale of the youngest prince who wanted to build a flawless church for his father, so as to inherit the kingdomThis he does, and nobody can discover a single flaw, but then an old man comes along and says, That's a fine church you've built, to be sure! What a pity the main wall is a bit crooked! The prince has the church pulled down again and builds a new one, but here too the old man discovers a flaw, and so on for the third time.
The old man thus represents knowledge, reflection, insight, wisdom, cleverness, and intuition on the one hand, and on the other, moral qualities such as goodwill and readiness to help, which make his spiritual character sufficiently plainSince the archetype is an autonomous content of the unconscious, the fairytale, which usually concretizes the archetypes, can cause the old man to appear in a dream in much the same way as happens in modern dreamsIn a Balkan tale the old man appears to the hard-pressed hero in a dream and gives him good advice about accomplishing the impossible tasks that have been imposed upon himHis relation to the unconscious is clearly expressed in one Russian fairytale, where he is called the King of the Forest. As the peasant sat down wearily on a tree stump, a little old man crept out: all wrinkled he was and a green beard hung down to his knees. Who are you? asked the peasantI am Och, King of the Forest, said the manikinThe peasant hired out his profligate son to him, and the King of the Forest departed with the young man, and conducted him to that other world under the earth and brought him to a green hut… In the hut everything was green: the walls were green and the benches, Och's wife was green and the children were green … and the little water-women who waited on him were as green as rue. Even the food was greenThe King of the Forest is here a vegetation or tree numen who reigns in the woods and, through the nixies, also has connections with water, which clearly shows his relation to the unconscious since the latter is frequently expressed through wood and water symbols.
There is equally a connection with the unconscious when the old man appears as a dwarfThe fairytale about the princess who was searching for her lover says: Night came and the darkness, and still the princess sat in the same place and weptAs she sat there lost in thought, she heard a voice greeting her: Good evening, pretty maid! Why are you sitting here so lonely and sad?' She sprang up hastily and felt very confused, and that was no wonderBut when she looked round there was only a tiny little old man standing before her, who nodded his head at her and looked so kind and simple. In a Swiss fairytale, the peasant's son who wants to bring the king's daughter a basket of apples encounters es chlis isigs Männdli, das frogt-ne, was er do i dem Chratte häig? (a little iron man who asked what he had there in the basket)In another passage the Männdli has es isigs Chlaidli a (iron clothes on)By isig presumably eisern (iron) is meant, which is more probable than eisig (icy)In the latter case it would have to be es Chlaidli vo Is (clothes of ice)There are indeed little ice men, and little metal men too; in fact, in a modern dream I have even come across a little black iron man who appeared at a critical juncture, like the one in this fairytale of the country bumpkin who wanted to marry the princess.
In a modern series of visions in which the figure of the wise old man occurred several times, he was on one occasion of normal size and appeared at the very bottom of a crater surrounded by high rocky walls; on another occasion he was a tiny figure on the top of a mountain, inside a low, stony enclosureWe find the same motif in Goethe's tale of the dwarf princess who lived in a casketIn this connection we might also mention the Anthroparion, the little leaden man of the Zosimos vision, as well as the metallic men who dwell in the mines, the crafty dactyls of antiquity, the homunculi of the alchemists, and the gnomic throng of hobgoblins, brownies, gremlins, etcHow real such conceptions are became clear to me on the occasion of a serious mountaineering accident: after the catastrophe two of the climbers had the collective vision, in broad daylight, of a little hooded man who scrambled out of an inaccessible crevasse in the ice face and passed across the glacier, creating a regular panic in the two beholdersI have often encountered motifs which made me think that the unconscious must be the world of the infinitesimally smallSuch an idea could be derived rationalistically from the obscure feeling that in all these visions we are dealing with something endopsychic, the inference being that a thing must be exceedingly small in order to fit inside the headI am no friend of any such rational conjectures, though I would not say that they are all beside the markIt seems to me more probable that this liking for diminutives on the one hand and for superlatives—giants, etc.—on the other is connected with the queer uncertainty of spatial and temporal relations in the unconsciousMan's sense of proportion, his rational conception of big and small, is distinctly anthropomorphic, and it loses its validity not only in the realm of physical phenomena but also in those parts of the collective unconscious beyond the range of the specifically humanThe atman is smaller than small and bigger than big, he is the size of a thumb yet he encompasses the earth on every side and rules over the ten-finger space. And of the Cabiri Goethe says: little in length / mighty in strength. In the same way, the archetype of the wise old man is quite tiny, almost imperceptible, and yet it possesses a fateful potency, as anyone can see when he gets down to fundamentalsThe archetypes have this peculiarity in common with the atomic world, which is demonstrating before our eyes that the more deeply the in vestigator penetrates into the universe of microphysics the more devastating are the explosive forces he finds enchained thereThat the greatest effects come from the smallest causes has become patently clear not only in physics but in the field of psychological research as wellHow often in the critical moments of life everything hangs on what appears to be a mere nothing!
In certain primitive fairytales, the illuminating quality of our archetype is expressed by the fact that the old man is identified with the sunHe brings a firebrand with him which he uses for roasting a pumpkinAfter he has eaten, he takes the fire away again, which causes mankind to steal it from himIn a North American Indian tale, the old man is a witch-doctor who owns the fireSpirit too has a fiery aspect, as we know from the language of the Old Testament and from the story of the Pentecostal miracle.
Apart from his cleverness, wisdom, and insight, the old man, as we have already mentioned, is also notable for his moral qualities; what is more, he even tests the moral qualities of others and makes his gifts dependent on this testThere is a particularly instructive example of this in the Estonian fairytale of the stepdaughter and the real daughterThe former is an orphan distinguished for her obedience and good behaviourThe story begins with her distaff falling into a wellShe jumps in after it, but does not drown, and comes to a magic country where, continuing her quest, she meets a cow, a ram, and an apple tree whose wishes she fulfilsShe now comes to a wash-house where a dirty old man is sitting who wants her to wash himThe following dialogue develops: Pretty maid, pretty maid, wash me, do, it is hard for me to be so dirty! What shall I heat the stove with? Collect wooden pegs and crows' dung and make a fire with that. But she fetches sticks, and asks, Where shall I get the bath-water? Under the barn there stands a white mareGet her to piss into the tub! But she takes clean water, and asks, Where shall I get a bath-switch? Cut off the white mare's tail and make a bath-switch of that! But she makes one out of birch-twigs, and asks, Where shall I get soap? Take a pumice-stone and scrub me with that! But she fetches soap from the village and with that she washes the old man.
As a reward he gives her a bag full of gold and precious stonesThe daughter of the house naturally becomes jealous, throws her distaff into the well, where she finds it again instantlyNevertheless she goes on and does everything wrong that the stepdaughter had done right, and is rewarded accordinglyThe frequency of this motif makes further examples superfluous.
The figure of the superior and helpful old man tempts one to connect him somehow or other with GodIn the German tale of the soldier and the black princess it is related how the princess, on whom a curse has been laid, creeps out of her iron coffin every night and devours the soldier standing guard over the tombOne soldier, when his turn came, tried to escapeThat evening he stole away, fled over the fields and mountains, and came to a beautiful meadowSuddenly a little man stood before him with a long grey beard, but it was none other than the Lord God himself, who could no longer go on looking at all the mischief the devil wrought every nightWhither away?' said the little grey man, may I come with you?' And because the little old man looked so friendly the soldier told him that he had run away and why he had done so. Good advice follows, as alwaysIn this story the old man is taken for God in the same naïve way that the English alchemist, Sir George Ripley, describes the old king as antiquus dierum—the Ancient of Days.
Just as all archetypes have a positive, favourable, bright side that points upwards, so also they have one that points downwards, partly negative and unfavourable, partly chthonic, but for the rest merely neutralTo this the spirit archetype is no exceptionEven his dwarf form implies a kind of limitation and suggests a naturalistic vegetation-numen sprung from the underworldIn one Balkan tale, the old man is handicapped by the loss of an eyeIt has been gouged out by the Vili, a species of winged demon, and the hero is charged with the task of getting them to restore it to himThe old man has therefore lost part of his eyesight—that is, his insight and enlightenment—to the daemonic world of darkness; this handicap is reminiscent of the fate of Osiris, who lost an eye at the sight of a black pig (his wicked brother Set), or again of Wotan, who sacrificed his eye at the spring of MimirCharacteristically enough, the animal ridden by the old man in our fairytale is a goat, a sign that he himself has a dark sideIn a Siberian tale, he appears as a one-legged, one-handed, and one-eyed greybeard who wakens a dead man with an iron staffIn the course of the story the latter, after being brought back to life several times, kills the old man by a mistake, and thus throws away his good fortuneThe story is entitled The One-sided Old Man, and in truth his handicap shows that he consists of one half onlyThe other half is invisible, but appears in the shape of a murderer who seeks the hero's lifeEventually the hero succeeds in killing his persistent murderer, but in the struggle he also kills the one-sided old man, so that the identity of the two victims is clearly revealedIt is thus possible that the old man is his own opposite, a life-bringer as well as a death-dealer—ad utrumque peritus (skilled in both), as is said of Hermes.
In these circumstances, whenever the simple and kindly old man appears, it is advisable for heuristic and other reasons to scrutinize the context with some careFor instance, in the Estonian tale we first mentioned, about the hired boy who lost the cow, there is a suspicion that the helpful old man who happened to be on the spot so opportunely had surreptitiously made away with the cow beforehand in order to give his protégé an excellent reason for taking to flightThis may very well be, for everyday experience shows that it is quite possible for a superior, though subliminal, foreknowledge of fate to contrive some annoying incident for the sole purpose of bullying our Simple Simon of an ego-consciousness into the way he should go, which for sheer stupidity he would never have found by himselfHad our orphan guessed that it was the old man who had whisked off his cow as if by magic, he would have seemed like a spiteful troll or a devilAnd indeed the old man has a wicked aspect too, just as the primitive medicine-man is a healer and helper and also the dreaded concocter of poisonsThe very word ϕáρμακον means poison' as well as antidote,' and poison can in fact be both.
The old man, then, has an ambiguous elfin character—witness the extremely instructive figure of Merlin—seeming, in certain of his forms, to be good incarnate and in others an aspect of evilThen again, he is the wicked magician who, from sheer egoism, does evil for evil's sakeIn a Siberian fairytale, he is an evil spirit on whose head were two lakes with two ducks swimming in them. He feeds on human fleshThe story relates how the hero and his companions go to a feast in the next village, leaving their dogs at homeThese, acting on the principle when the cat's away the mice do play, also arrange a feast, at the climax of which they all hurl themselves on the stores of meatThe men return home and chase out the dogs, who dash off into the wildernessThen the Creator spoke to Ememqut the hero of the tale: Go and look for the dogs with your wife.' But he gets caught in a terrible snow-storm and has to seek shelter in the hut of the evil spiritThere now follows the well-known motif of the biter bitThe Creator is Ememqut's father, but the father of the Creator is called the Self-created because he created himselfAlthough we are nowhere told that the old man with the two lakes on his head lured the hero and his wife into the hut in order to satisfy his hunger, it may be conjectured that a very peculiar spirit must have got into the dogs to cause them to celebrate a feast like the men and afterwards—contrary to their nature—to run away, so that Ememqut had to go out and look for them; and that the hero was then caught in a snow-storm in order to drive him into the arms of the wicked old manThe fact that the Creator, son of the Self-created, was a party to the advice raises a knotty problem whose solution we had best leave to the Siberian theologians.
In a Balkan fairytale the old man gives the childless Czarina a magic apple to eat, from which she becomes pregnant and bears a son, it being stipulated that the old man shall be his godfatherThe boy, however, grows up into a horrid little tough who bullies all the children and slaughters the cattleFor ten years he is given no nameThen the old man appears, sticks a knife into his leg, and calls him the Knife Prince. The boy now wants to set forth on his adventures, which his father, after long hesitation, finally allows him to doThe knife in his leg is of vital importance: If he draws it out himself, he will live; if anybody else does so, he will dieIn the end the knife becomes his doom, for an old witch pulls it out when he is asleepHe dies, but is restored to life by the friends he has wonHere the old man is a helper, but also the contriver of a dangerous fate which might just as easily have turned out for the badThe evil showed itself early and plainly in the boy's villainous character.
In another Balkan tale, there is a variant of our motif that is worth mentioning: A king is looking for his sister who has been abducted by a strangerHis wanderings bring him to the hut of an old woman, who warns him against continuing the searchBut a tree laden with fruit, ever receding before him, lures him away from the hutWhen at last the tree comes to a halt, an old man climbs down from the branchesHe regales the king and takes him to a castle, where the sister is living with the old man as his wifeShe tells her brother that the old man is a wicked spirit who will kill himAnd sure enough, three days afterwards, the king vanishes without traceHis younger brother now takes up the search and kills the wicked spirit in the form of a dragonA handsome young man is thereby released from the spell and forthwith marries the sisterThe old man, appearing at first as a tree-numen, is obviously connected with the sisterHe is a murdererIn an interpolated episode, he is accused of enchanting a whole city by turning it to iron, i.e., making it immovable, rigid, and locked upHe also holds the king's sister a captive and will not let her return to her relativesThis amounts to saying that the sister is animus-possessedThe old man is therefore to be regarded as her animusBut the manner in which the king is drawn into this possession, and the way he seeks for his sister, make us think that she has an anima significance for her brotherThe fateful archetype of the old man has accordingly first taken possession of the king's anima—in other words, robbed him of the archetype of life which the anima personifies—and forced him to go in search of the lost charm, the treasure hard to attain, thus making him the mythical hero, the higher personality who is an expression of the selfMeanwhile, the old man acts the part of the villain and has to be forcibly removed, only to appear at the end as the husband of the sister-anima, or more properly as the bridegroom of the soul, who celebrates the sacred incest that symbolizes the union of opposites and equalsThis bold enantiodromia, a very common occurrence, not only signifies the rejuvenation and transformation of the old man, but hints at a secret inner relation of evil to good and vice versa.
So in this story we see the archetype of the old man in the guise of an evil-doer, caught up in all the twists and turns of an individuation process that ends suggestively with the hieros gamosConversely, in the Russian tale of the Forest King, he starts by being helpful and benevolent, but then refuses to let his hired boy go, so that the main episodes in the story deal with the boy's repeated attempts to escape from the clutches of the magicianInstead of the quest we have flight, which nonetheless appears to win the same reward as adventures valiantly sought, for in the end the hero marries the king's daughterThe magician, however, must rest content with the role of the biter bit.
The description of our archetype would not be complete if we omitted to consider one special form of its manifestation, namely its animal formThis belongs essentially to the theriomorphism of gods and demons and has the same psychological significanceThe animal form shows that the contents and functions in question are still in the extrahuman sphere, i.e., on a plane beyond human consciousness, and consequently have a share on the one hand in the daemonically superhuman and on the other in the bestially subhumanIt must be remembered, however, that this division is only true within the sphere of consciousness, where it is a necessary condition of thoughtLogic says tertium non datur, meaning that we cannot envisage the opposites in their onenessIn other words, while the abolition of an obstinate antinomy can be no more than a postulate for us, this is by no means so for the unconscious, whose contents are without exception paradoxical or antinomial by nature, not excluding the category of beingIf anyone unacquainted with the psychology of the unconscious wants to get a working knowledge of these matters, I would recommend a study of Christian mysticism and Indian philosophy, where he will find the clearest elaboration of the antinomies of the unconscious.
Although the old man has, up to now, looked and behaved more or less like a human being, his magical powers and his spiritual superiority suggest that, in good and bad alike, he is outside, or above, or below the human levelNeither for the primitive nor for the unconscious does his animal aspect imply any devaluation, for in certain respects the animal is superior to manIt has not yet blundered into consciousness nor pitted a self-willed ego against the power from which it lives; on the contrary, it fulfils the will that actuates it in a well-nigh perfect mannerWere it conscious, it would be morally better than manThere is deep doctrine in the legend of the fall: it is the expression of a dim presentiment that the emancipation of ego-consciousness was a Luciferian deedMan's whole history consists from the very beginning in a conflict between his feeling of inferiority and his arroganceWisdom seeks the middle path and pays for this audacity by a dubious affinity with daemon and beast, and so is open to moral misinterpretation.
Again and again in fairytales we encounter the motif of helpful animalsThese act like humans, speak a human language, and display a sagacity and a knowledge superior to man'sIn these circumstances we can say with some justification that the archetype of the spirit is being expressed through an animal formA German fairytale relates how a young man, while searching for his lost princess, meets a wolf, who says, Do not be afraid! But tell me, where is your way leading you? The young man recounts his story, whereupon the wolf gives him as a magic gift a few of his hairs, with which the young man can summon his help at any timeThis intermezzo proceeds exactly like the meeting with the helpful old manIn the same story, the archetype also displays its other, wicked sideIn order to make this clear I shall give a summary of the story:
While the young man is watching his pigs in the wood, he discovers a large tree, whose branches lose themselves in the cloudsHow would it be, says he to himself, if you were to look at the world from the top of that great tree? So he climbs up, all day long he climbs, without even reaching the branchesEvening comes, and he has to pass the night in a fork of the treeNext day he goes on climbing and by noon has reached the foliageOnly towards evening does he come to a village nestling in the branchesThe peasants who live there give him food and shelter for the nightIn the morning he climbs still furtherTowards noon, he reaches a castle in which a young girl livesHere he finds that the tree goes no higherShe is a king's daughter, held prisoner by a wicked magicianSo the young man stays with the princess, and she allows him to go into all the rooms of the castle: one room alone she forbids him to enterBut curiosity is too strongHe unlocks the door, and there in the room he finds a raven fixed to the wall with three nailsOne nail goes through his throat, the two others through the wingsThe raven complains of thirst and the young man, moved by pity, gives him water to drinkAt each sip a nail falls out, and at the third sip the raven is free and flies out at the windowWhen the princess hears of it she is very frightened and says, That was the devil who enchanted me! It won't be long now before he fetches me again. And one fine morning she has indeed vanished.
The young man now sets out in search of her and, as we have described above, meets the wolfIn the same way he meets a bear and a lion, who also give him some hairsIn addition the lion informs him that the princess is imprisoned nearby in a hunting-lodgeThe young man finds the house and the princess, but is told that flight is impossible, because the hunter possesses a three-legged white horse that knows everything and would infallibly warn its masterDespite that, the young man tries to flee away with her, but in vainThe hunter overtakes him but, because he had saved his life as a raven, lets him go and rides off again with the princessWhen the hunter has disappeared into the wood, the young man creeps back to the house and persuades the princess to wheedle from the hunter the secret of how he obtained his clever white horseThis she successfully does in the night, and the young man, who has hidden himself under the bed, learns that about an hour's journey from the hunting-lodge there dwells a witch who breeds magic horsesWhoever was able to guard the foals for three days might choose a horse as a rewardIn former times, said the hunter, she used to make a gift of twelve lambs into the bargain, in order to satisfy the hunger of the twelve wolves who lived in the woods near the farmstead, and prevent them from attacking; but to him she gave no lambsSo the wolves followed him as he rode away, and while crossing the borders of her domain they succeeded in tearing off one of his horse's hoofsThat was why it had only three legs.
Then the young man made haste to seek out the witch and agreed to serve her on condition that she gave him not only a horse of his own choosing but twelve lambs as wellTo this she consentedInstantly she commanded the foals to run away, and, to make him sleepy, she gave him brandyHe drinks, falls asleep, and the foals escapeOn the first day he catches them with the help of the wolf, on the second day the bear helps him, and on the third the lionHe can now go and choose his rewardThe witch's little daughter tells him which horse her mother ridesThis is naturally the best horse, and it too is whiteHardly has he got it out of the stall when the witch pierces the four hoofs and sucks the marrow out of the bonesFrom this she bakes a cake and gives it to the young man for his journeyThe horse grows deathly weak, but the young man feeds it on the cake, whereupon the horse recovers its former strengthHe gets out of the woods unscathed after quieting the twelve wolves with the twelve lambsHe then fetches the princess and rides away with herBut the three-legged horse calls out to the hunter, who sets off in pursuit and quickly catches up with them, because the four-legged horse refuses to gallopAs the hunter approaches, the four-legged horse cries out to the three-legged, Sister, throw him off! The magician is thrown and trampled to pieces by the two horsesThe young man sets the princess on the three-legged horse, and the pair of them ride away to her father's kingdom, where they get marriedThe four-legged horse begs him to cut off both their heads, for otherwise they would bring disaster upon himThis he does, and the horses are transformed into a handsome prince and a wonderfully beautiful princess, who after a while repair to their own kingdom. They had been changed into horses by the hunter, long ago.
Apart from the theriomorphic spirit symbolism in this tale, it is especially interesting to note that the function of knowing and intuition is represented by a riding-animalThis is as much as to say that the spirit can be somebody's propertyThe three-legged white horse is thus the property of the demonic hunter, and the four-legged one the property of the witchSpirit is here partly a function, which like any other object (horse) can change its owner, and partly an autonomous subject (magician as owner of the horse)By obtaining the four-legged horse from the witch, the young man frees a spirit or a thought of some special kind from the grip of the unconsciousHere as elsewhere, the witch stands for a mater natura or the original matriarchal state of the unconscious, indicating a psychic constitution in which the unconscious is opposed only by a feeble and still-dependent consciousnessThe four-legged horse shows itself superior to the three-legged, since it can command the latterAnd since the quaternity is a symbol of wholeness and wholeness plays a considerable role in the picture-world of the unconscious, the victory of four-leggedness over three-leggedness is not altogether unexpectedBut what is the meaning of the opposition between threeness and fourness, or rather, what does threeness mean as compared with wholeness? In alchemy this problem is known as the axiom of Maria and runs all through alchemical philosophy for more than a thousand years, finally to be taken up again in the Cabiri scene in FaustThe earliest literary version of it is to be found in the opening words of Plato's Timaeus of which Goethe gives us a reminderAmong the alchemists we can see clearly how the divine Trinity has its counterpart in a lower, chthonic triad (similar to Dante's three-headed devil)This represents a principle which, by reason of its symbolism, betrays affinities with evil, though it is by no means certain that it expresses nothing but evilEverything points rather to the fact that evil, or its familiar symbolism, belongs to the family of figures which describe the dark, nocturnal, lower, chthonic elementIn this symbolism the lower stands to the higher as a correspondence in reverse; that is to say it is conceived, like the upper, as a triadThree, being a masculine number, is logically correlated with the wicked hunter, who can be thought of alchemically as the lower triadFour, a feminine number, is assigned to the old womanThe two horses are miraculous animals that talk and know and thus represent the unconscious spirit, which in one case is subordinated to the wicked magician and in the other to the old witch.
Between the three and the four there exists the primary opposition of male and female, but whereas fourness is a symbol of wholeness, threeness is notThe latter, according to alchemy, denotes polarity, since one triad always presupposes another, just as high presupposes low, lightness darkness, good evilIn terms of energy, polarity means a potential, and wherever a potential exists there is the possibility of a current, a flow of events, for the tension of opposites strives for balanceIf one imagines the quaternity as a square divided into two halves by a diagonal, one gets two triangles whose apices point in opposite directionsOne could therefore say metaphorically that if the wholeness symbolized by the quaternity is divided into equal halves, it produces two opposing triadsThis simple reflection shows how three can be derived from four, and in the same way the hunter of the captured princess explains how his horse, from being four-legged, became three-legged, through having one hoof torn off by the twelve wolvesThe three-leggedness is due to an accident, therefore, which occurred at the very moment when the horse was leaving the territory of the dark motherIn psychological language we should say that when the unconscious wholeness becomes manifest, i.e., leaves the unconscious and crosses over into the sphere of consciousness, one of the four remains behind, held fast by the horror vacui of the unconsciousThere thus arises a triad, which as we know—not from the fairytale but from the history of symbolism—constellates a corresponding triad in opposition to it—in other words, a conflict ensuesHere too we could ask with Socrates, One, two, three—but, my dear Timaeus, of those who yesterday were the banqueters and today are the banquet-givers, where is the fourth? He has remained in the realm of the dark mother, caught by the wolfish greed of the unconscious, which is unwilling to let anything escape from its magic circle save at the cost of a sacrifice.
The hunter or old magician and the witch correspond to the negative parental imagos in the magic world of the unconsciousThe hunter first appears in the story as a black ravenHe has stolen away the princess and holds her a prisonerShe describes him as the devil. But it is exceedingly odd that he himself is locked up in the one forbidden room of the castle and fixed to the wall with three nails, as though crucifiedHe is imprisoned, like all jailers, in his own prison, and bound like all who curseThe prison of both is a magic castle at the top of a gigantic tree, presumably the world-treeThe princess belongs to the upper region of light near the sunSitting there in captivity on the world-tree, she is a kind of anima mundi who has got herself into the power of darknessBut this catch does not seem to have done the latter much good either, seeing that the captor is crucified and moreover with three nailsThe crucifixion evidently betokens a state of agonizing bondage and suspension, fit punishment for one foolhardy enough to venture like a Prometheus into the orbit of the opposing principleThis was what the raven, who is identical with the hunter, did when he ravished a precious soul from the upper world of light; and so, as a punishment, he is nailed to the wall in that upper worldThat this is an inverted reflection of the primordial Christian image should be obvious enoughThe Saviour who freed the soul of humanity from the dominion of the prince of this world was nailed to a cross down below on earth, just as the thieving raven is nailed to the wall in the celestial branches of the world-tree for his presumptuous meddlingIn our fairytale, the peculiar instrument of the magic spell is the triad of nailsWho it was that made the raven captive is not told in the tale, but it sounds as if a spell had been laid upon him in the triune name.
Having climbed up the world-tree and penetrated into the magic castle where he is to rescue the princess, our young hero is permitted to enter all the rooms but one, the very room in which the raven is imprisonedJust as in paradise there was one tree of which it was forbidden to eat, so here there is one room that is not to be opened, with the natural result that it is entered at onceNothing excites our interest more than a prohibitionIt is the surest way of provoking disobedienceObviously there is some secret scheme afoot to free not so much the princess as the ravenAs soon as the hero catches sight of him, the raven begins to cry piteously and to complain of thirst, and the young man, moved by the virtue of compassion, slakes it, not with hyssop and gall, but with quickening water, whereupon the three nails fall out and the raven escapes through the open windowThus the evil spirit regains his freedom, changes into the hunter, steals the princess for the second time, but this time locks her up in his hunting-lodge on earthThe secret scheme is partially unveiled: the princess must be brought down from the upper world to the world of men, which was evidently not possible without the help of the evil spirit and man's disobedience.
But since in the human world, too, the hunter of souls is the princess's master, the hero has to intervene anew, to which end, as we have seen, he filches the four-legged horse from the witch and breaks the three-legged spell of the magicianIt was the triad that first transfixed the raven, and the triad also represents the power of the evil spiritThese are the two triads that point in opposite directions.
Turning now to quite another field, the realm of psychological experience, we know that three of the four functions of consciousness can become differentiated, i.e., conscious, while the other remains connected with the matrix, the unconscious, and is known as the inferior functionIt is the Achilles heel of even the most heroic consciousness: somewhere the strong man is weak, the clever man foolish, the good man bad, and the reverse is also trueIn our fairytale the triad appears as a mutilated quaternityIf only one leg could be added to the other three, it would make a wholeThe enigmatic axiom of Maria runs: … from the third comes the one as the fourth (έκ τοῡ τρíτου τò ἓν τέταρτον) —which presumably means, when the third produces the fourth it at once produces unityThe lost component which is in the possession of the wolves belonging to the Great Mother is indeed only a quarter, but, together with the three, it makes a whole which does away with division and conflict.
But how is it that a quarter, on the evidence of symbolism, is at the same time a triad? Here the symbolism of our fairytale leaves us in the lurch, and we are obliged to have recourse to the facts of psychologyI have said previously that three functions can become differentiated, and only one remains under the spell of the unconsciousThis statement must be defined more closelyIt is an empirical fact that only one function becomes more or less successfully differentiated, which on that account is known as the superior or main function, and together with extraversion or introversion constitutes the type of conscious attitudeThis function has associated with it one or two partially differentiated auxiliary functions which hardly ever attain the same degree of differentiation as the main function, that is, the same degree of applicability by the willAccordingly they possess a higher degree of spontaneity than the main function, which displays a large measure of reliability and is amenable to our intentionsThe fourth, inferior function proves on the other hand to be inaccessible to our willIt appears now as a teasing and distracting imp, now as a deus ex machinaBut always it comes and goes of its own volitionFrom this it is clear that even the differentiated functions have only partially freed themselves from the unconscious; for the rest they are still rooted in it and to that extent they operate under its ruleHence the three differentiated functions at the disposal of the ego have three corresponding unconscious components that have not yet broken loose from the unconsciousAnd just as the three conscious and differentiated parts of these functions are confronted by a fourth, undifferentiated function which acts as a painfully disturbing factor, so also the superior function seems to have its worst enemy in the unconsciousNor should we omit to mention one final turn of the screw: like the devil who delights in disguising himself as an angel of light, the inferior function secretly and mischievously influences the superior function most of all, just as the latter represses the former most strongly.
These unfortunately somewhat abstract formulations are necessary in order to throw some light on the tricky and allusive associations in our—save the mark!—childishly simple fairytaleThe two antithetical triads, the one banning and the other representing the power of evil, tally to a hair's breadth with the functional structure of the conscious and unconscious psycheBeing a spontaneous, naïve, and uncontrived product of the psyche, the fairytale cannot very well express anything except what the psyche actually isIt is not only our fairytale that depicts these structural psychic relations, but countless other fairytales do the same.
Our fairytale reveals with unusual clarity the essentially antithetical nature of the spirit archetype, while on the other hand it shows the bewildering play of antinomies all aiming at the great goal of higher consciousnessThe young swineherd who climbs from the animal level up to the top of the giant world-tree and there, in the upper world of light, discovers his captive anima, the high-born princess, symbolizes the ascent of consciousness, rising from almost bestial regions to a lofty perch with a broad outlook, which is a singularly appropriate image for the enlargement of the conscious horizonOnce the masculine consciousness has attained this height, it comes face to face with its feminine counterpart, the animaShe is a personification of the unconsciousThe meeting shows how inept it is to designate the latter as the subconscious: it is not merely below consciousness but also above it, so far above it indeed that the hero has to climb up to it with considerable effortThis upper unconscious, however, is far from being a supercon-conscious in the sense that anyone who reaches it, like our hero, would stand as high above the subconscious as above the earth's surfaceOn the contrary, he makes the disagreeable discovery that his high and mighty anima, the Princess Soul, is bewitched up there and no freer than a bird in a golden cageHe may pat himself on the back for having soared up from the flatlands and from almost bestial stupidity, but his soul is in the power of an evil spirit, a sinister father-imago of subterrene nature in the guise of a raven, the celebrated theriomorphic figure of the devilWhat use now is his lofty perch and his wide horizon, when his own dear soul is languishing in prison? Worse, she plays the game of the underworld and ostensibly tries to stop the young man from discovering the secret of her imprisonment, by forbidding him to enter that one roomBut secretly she leads him to it by the very fact of her vetoIt is as though the unconscious had two hands of which one always does the opposite of the otherThe princess wants and does not want to be rescuedBut the evil spirit too has got himself into a fix, by all accounts: he wanted to filch a fine soul from the shining upper world—which he could easily do as a winged being—but had not bargained on being shut up there himselfBlack spirit though he is, he longs for the lightThat is his secret justification, just as his being spellbound is a punishment for his transgressionBut so long as the evil spirit is caught in the upper world, the princess cannot get down to earth either, and the hero remains lost in paradiseSo now he commits the sin of disobedience and thereby enables the robber to escape, thus causing the abduction of the princess for the second time—a whole chain of calamitiesIn the result, however, the princess comes down to earth and the devilish raven assumes the human shape of the hunterThe other-worldly anima and the evil principle both descend to the human sphere, that is, they dwindle to human proportions and thus become approachableThe three-legged, all-knowing horse represents the hunter's own power: it corresponds to the unconscious components of the differentiated functionsThe hunter himself personifies the inferior function, which also manifests itself in the hero as his inquisitiveness and love of adventureAs the story unfolds, he becomes more and more like the hunter: he too obtains his horse from the witchBut, unlike him, the hunter omitted to obtain the twelve lambs in order to feed the wolves, who then injured his horseHe forgot to pay tribute to the chthonic powers because he was nothing but a robberThrough this omission the hero learns that the unconscious lets its creatures go only at the cost of sacrificeThe number  is presumably a time symbol, with the subsidiary meaning of the twelve labours (θλα) that have to be performed for the unconscious before one can get freeThe hunter looks like a previous unsuccessful attempt of the hero to gain possession of his soul through robbery and violenceBut the conquest of the soul is in reality a work of patience, self-sacrifice, and devotionBy gaining possession of the four-legged horse the hero steps right into the shoes of the hunter and carries off the princess as wellThe quaternity in our tale proves to be the greater power, for it integrates into its totality that which it still needed in order to become whole.
The archetype of the spirit in this, be it said, by no means primitive fairytale is expressed theriomorphically as a system of three functions which is subordinated to a unity, the evil spirit, in the same way that some unnamed authority has crucified the raven with a triad of three nailsThe two supraordinate unities correspond in the first case to the inferior function which is the arch-enemy of the main function, namely to the hunter; and in the second case to the main function, namely to the heroHunter and hero are ultimately equated with one another, so that the hunter's function is resolved in the heroAs a matter of fact, the hero lies dormant in the hunter from the very beginning, egging him on, with all the unmoral means at his disposal, to carry out the rape of the soul, and then causing him to play her into the hero's hands against the hunter's willOn the surface a furious conflict rages between them, but down below the one goes about the other's businessThe knot is unravelled directly the hero succeeds in capturing the quaternity—or in psychological language, when he assimilates the inferior function into the ternary systemThat puts an end to the conflict at one blow, and the figure of the hunter melts into thin airAfter this victory, the hero sets his princess upon the three-legged steed and together they ride away to her father's kingdomFrom now on she rules and personifies the realm of spirit that formerly served the wicked hunterThus the anima is and remains the representative of that part of the unconscious which can never be assimilated into a humanly attainable whole.
PostscriptOnly after the completion of my manuscript was my attention drawn by a friend to a Russian variant of our storyIt bears the title Maria Morevna. The hero of the story is no swineherd, but Czarevitch IvanThere is an interesting explanation of the three helpful animals: they correspond to Ivan's three sisters and their husbands, who are really birdsThe three sisters represent an unconscious triad of functions related to both the animal and spiritual realmsThe bird-men are a species of angel and emphasize the auxiliary nature of the unconscious functionsIn the story they intervene at the critical moment when the hero—unlike his German counterpart—gets into the power of the evil spirit and is killed and dismembered (the typical fate of the God-man!)The evil spirit is an old man who is often shown naked and is called Koschei the DeathlessThe corresponding witch is the well-known Baba YagaThe three helpful animals of the German variant are doubled here, appearing first as the bird-men and then as the lion, the strange bird, and the beesThe princess is Queen Maria Morevna, a redoubtable martial leader—Mary the queen of heaven is lauded in the Russian Orthodox hymnal as leader of hosts!—who has chained up the evil spirit with twelve chains in the forbidden room in her castleWhen Ivan slakes the old devil's thirst he makes off with the queenThe magic riding animals do not in the end turn into human beingsThis Russian story has a distinctly more primitive character.
The following remarks lay no claim to general interest, being in the main technicalI wanted at first to delete them from this revised version of my essay, but then I changed my mind and appended them in a supplementThe reader who is not specifically interested in psychology can safely skip this sectionFor, in what follows, I have dealt with the abstruse-looking problem of the three- and four-leggedness of the magic horses, and presented my reflections in such a way as to demonstrate the method I have employedThis piece of psychological reasoning rests firstly on the irrational data of the material, that is, of the fairytale, myth, or dream, and secondly on the conscious realization of the latent rational connections which these data have with one anotherThat such connections exist at all is something of a hypothesis, like that which asserts that dreams have a meaningThe truth of this assumption is not established a priori: its usefulness can only be proved by applicationIt therefore remains to be seen whether its methodical application to irrational material enables one to interpret the latter in a meaningful wayIts application consists in approaching the material as if it had a coherent inner meaningFor this purpose most of the data require a certain amplification, that is, they need to be clarified, generalized, and approximated to a more or less general concept in accordance with Cardan's rule of interpretationFor instance, the three-leggedness, in order to be recognized for what it is, has first to be separated from the horse and then approximated to its specific principle—the principle of threenessLikewise, the four-leggedness in the fairytale, when raised to the level of a general concept, enters into relationship with the threeness, and as a result we have the enigma mentioned in the Timaeus, the problem of three and fourTriads and tetrads represent archetypal structures that play a significant part in all symbolism and are equally important for the investigation of myths and dreamsBy raising the irrational datum (three-leggedness and four-leggedness) to the level of a general concept we elicit the universal meaning of this motif and encourage the inquiring mind to tackle the problem seriouslyThis task involves a series of reflections and deductions of a technical nature which I would not wish to withhold from the psychologically interested reader and especially from the professional, the less so as this labour of the intellect represents a typical unravelling of symbols and is indispensable for an adequate understanding of the products of the unconsciousOnly in this way can the nexus of unconscious relationships be made to yield their own meaning, in contrast to those deductive interpretations derived from a preconceived theory, e.g., interpretations based on astronomy, meteorology, mythology, and—last but not least—the sexual theory.
The three-legged and four-legged horses are in truth a recondite matter worthy of closer examinationThe three and the four remind us not only of the dilemma we have already met in the theory of psychological functions, but also of the axiom of Maria Prophetissa, which plays a considerable role in alchemyIt may therefore be rewarding to examine more closely the meaning of the miraculous horses.
The first thing that seems to me worthy of note is that the three-legged horse which is assigned to the princess as her mount is a mare, and is moreover herself a bewitched princessThreeness is unmistakably connected here with femininity, whereas from the dominating religious standpoint of consciousness it is an exclusively masculine affair, quite apart from the fact that , as an uneven number, is masculine in the first placeOne could therefore translate threeness as masculinity outright, this being all the more significant when one remembers the ancient Egyptian triunity of God, Ka-mutef, and Pharaoh.
Three-leggedness, as the attribute of some animal, denotes the unconscious masculinity immanent in a female creatureIn a real woman it would correspond to the animus who, like the magic horse, represents spirit. In the case of the anima, however, threeness does not coincide with any Christian idea of the Trinity but with the lower triangle, the inferior function triad that constitutes the shadow. The inferior half of the personality is for the greater part unconsciousIt does not denote the whole of the unconscious, but only the personal segment of itThe anima, on the other hand, so far as she is distinguished from the shadow, personifies the collective unconsciousIf threeness is assigned to her as a riding-animal, it means that she rides the shadow, is related to it as the marIn that case she possesses the shadowBut if she herself is the horse, then she has lost her dominating position as a personification of the collective unconscious and is ridden—possessed—by Princess A, spouse of the heroAs the fairytale rightly says, she has been changed by witchcraft into the three-legged horse (Princess B).
Princess A is the anima of the heroShe rides—that is, possesses—the three-legged horse, who is the shadow, the inferior function-triad of her later spouseTo put it more simply: she has taken possession of the inferior half of the hero's personalityShe has caught him on his weak side, as so often happens in ordinary life, for where one is weak one needs support and completionIn fact, a woman's place is on the weak side of a manThis is how we would have to formulate the situation if we regarded the hero and Princess A as two ordinary peopleBut since it is a fairy-story played out mainly in the world of magic, we are probably more correct in interpreting Princess A as the hero's animaIn that case the hero has been wafted out of the profane world through his encounter with the anima, like Merlin by his fairy: as an ordinary man he is like one caught in a marvellous dream, viewing the world through a veil of mist.
The matter is now considerably complicated by the unexpected fact that the three-legged horse is a mare, an equivalent of Princess AShe (the mare) is Princess B, who in the shape of a horse corresponds to Princess A's shadow (i.e., her inferior function-triad)Princess B, however, differs from Princess A in that, unlike her, she does not ride the horse but is contained in it: she is bewitched and has thus come under the spell of a masculine triadTherefore, she is possessed by a shadow.
The question now is, whose shadow? It cannot be the shadow of the hero, for this is already taken up by the latter's animaThe fairytale gives us the answer: it is the hunter or magician who has bewitched herAs we have seen, the hunter is somehow connected with the hero, since the latter gradually puts himself in his shoesHence one could easily arrive at the conjecture that the hunter is at bottom none other than the shadow of the heroBut this supposition is contradicted by the fact that the hunter stands for a formidable power which extends not only to the hero's anima but much further, namely to the royal brother-sister pair of whose existence the hero and his anima have no notion, and who appear very much out of the blue in the story itselfThe power that extends beyond the orbit of the individual has a more than individual character and cannot therefore be identified with the shadow, if we conceive and define this as the dark half of the personalityAs a supra-individual factor the numen of the hunter is a dominant of the collective unconscious, and its characteristic features-hunter, magician, raven, miraculous horse, crucifixion or suspension high up in the boughs of the world-tree—touch the Germanic psyche very closelyHence the Christian Weltanschauung, when reflected in the ocean of the (Germanic) unconscious, logically takes on the features of WotanIn the figure of the hunter we meet an imago dei, a God-image, for Wotan is also a god of winds and spirits, on which account the Romans fittingly interpreted him as Mercury.
The Prince and his sister, Princess B, have therefore been seized by a pagan god and changed into horses, i.e., thrust down to the animal level, into the realm of the unconsciousThe inference is that in their proper human shape the pair of them once belonged to the sphere of collective consciousnessBut who are they?
In order to answer this question we must proceed from the fact that these two are an undoubted counterpart of the hero and Princess AThey are connected with the latter also because they serve as their mounts, and in consequence they appear as their lower, animal halvesBecause of its almost total unconsciousness, the animal has always symbolized the psychic sphere in man which lies hidden in the darkness of the body's instinctual lifeThe hero rides the stallion, characterized by the even (feminine) number ; Princess A rides the mare who has only three legs ( = a masculine number)These numbers make it clear that the transformation into animals has brought with it a modification of sex character: the stallion has a feminine attribute, the mare a masculine onePsychology can confirm this development as follows: to the degree that a man is overpowered by the (collective) unconscious there is not only a more unbridled intrusion of the instinctual sphere, but a certain feminine character also makes its appearance, which I have suggested should be called anima. If, on the other hand, a woman comes under the domination of the unconscious, the darker side of her feminine nature emerges all the more strongly, coupled with markedly masculine traitsThese latter are comprised under the term animus.
According to the fairytale, however, the animal form of the brother-sister pair is unreal and due simply to the magic influence of the pagan hunter-godIf they were nothing but animals, we could rest content with this interpretationBut that would be to pass over in unmerited silence the singular allusion to a modification of sex characterThe white horses are no ordinary horses: they are miraculous beasts with supernatural powersTherefore the human figures out of which the horses were magically conjured must likewise have had something supernatural about themThe fairytale makes no comment here, but if our assumption is correct that the two animal forms correspond to the subhuman components of hero and princess, then it follows that the human forms—Prince and Princess B—must correspond to their superhuman componentsThe superhuman quality of the original swineherd is shown by the fact that he becomes a hero, practically a half-god, since he does not stay with his swine but climbs the world-tree, where he is very nearly made its prisoner, like WotanSimilarly, he could not have become like the hunter if he did not have a certain resemblance to him in the first placeIn the same way the imprisonment of Princess A on the top of the world-tree proves her electness, and in so far as she shares the hunter's bed, as stated by the tale, she is actually the bride of God.
It is these extraordinary forces of heroism and election, bordering on the superhuman, which involve two quite ordinary humans in a superhuman fateAccordingly, in the profane world a swineherd becomes a king, and a princess gets an agreeable husbandBut since, for fairytales, there is not only a profane but also a magical world, human fate does not have the final wordThe fairytale therefore does not omit to point out what happens in the world of magicThere too a prince and princess have got into the power of the evil spirit, who is himself in a tight corner from which he cannot extricate himself without extraneous helpSo the human fate that befalls the swineherd and Princess A is paralleled in the world of magicBut in so far as the hunter is a pagan God-image and thus exalted above the world of heroes and paramours of the gods, the parallelism goes beyond the merely magical into a divine and spiritual sphere, where the evil spirit, the Devil himself—or at least a devil—is bound by the spell of an equally mighty or even mightier counter-principle indicated by the three nailsThis supreme tension of opposites, the mainspring of the whole drama, is obviously the conflict between the upper and lower triads, or, to put it in theological terms, between the Christian God and the devil who has assumed the features of Wotan.
We must, it seems, start from this highest level if we want to understand the story correctly, for the drama takes its rise from the initial transgression of the evil spiritThe immediate consequence of this is his crucifixionIn that distressing situation he needs outside help, and as it is not forthcoming from above, it can only be summoned from belowA young swineherd, possessed with the boyish spirit of adventure, is reckless and inquisitive enough to climb the world-treeHad he fallen and broken his neck, no doubt everybody would have said, What evil spirit could have given him the crazy idea of climbing up an enormous tree like that! Nor would they have been altogether wrong, for that is precisely what the evil spirit was afterThe capture of Princess A was a transgression in the profane world, and the bewitching of the—as we may suppose—semidivine brother-sister pair was just such an enormity in the magical worldWe do not know, but it is possible, that this heinous crime was committed before the bewitching of Princess AAt any rate, both episodes point to a transgression of the evil spirit in the magical world as well as in the profane.
It is assuredly not without a deeper meaning that the rescuer or redeemer should be a swineherd, like the Prodigal SonHe is of lowly origin and has this much in common with the curious conception of the redeemer in alchemyHis first liberating act is to deliver the evil spirit from the divine punishment meted out to himIt is from this act, representing the first stage of the lysis, that the whole dramatic tangle develops.
The moral of this story is in truth exceedingly oddThe finale satisfies in so far as the swineherd and Princess A are married and become the royal pairPrince and Princess B likewise celebrate their wedding, but this—in accordance with the archaic prerogative of kings—takes the form of incest, which, though somewhat repellent, must be regarded as more or less habitual in semidivine circlesBut what, we may ask, happens to the evil spirit, whose rescue from condign punishment sets the whole thing in motion? The wicked hunter is trampled to pieces by the horses, which presumably does no lasting damage to a spiritApparently he vanishes without trace, but only apparently, for he does after all leave a trace behind him, namely a hard-won happiness in both the profane and the magical worldTwo halves of the quaternity, represented on one side by the swineherd and Princess A and on the other by Prince and Princess B, have each come together and united: two marriage-pairs now confront one another, parallel but otherwise divided, inasmuch as the one pair belongs to the profane and the other to the magical worldBut in spite of this indubitable division, secret psychological connections, as we have seen, exist between them which allow us to derive the one pair from the other.
Speaking in the spirit of the fairytale, which unfolds its drama from the highest point, one would have to say that the world of half-gods is anterior to the profane world and produces it out of itself, just as the world of half-gods must be thought of as proceeding from the world of godsConceived in this way, the swineherd and Princess A are nothing less than earthly simulacra of Prince and Princess B, who in their turn would be the descendants of divine prototypesNor should we forget that the horse-breeding witch belongs to the hunter as his female counterpart, rather like an ancient Epona (the Celtic goddess of horses)Unfortunately we are not told how the magical conjuration into horses happenedBut it is evident that the witch had a hand in the game because both the horses were raised from her stock and are thus, in a sense, her productionsHunter and witch form a pair—the reflection, in the nocturnalchthonic part of the magical world, of a divine parental pairThe latter is easily recognized in the central Christian idea of sponsus et sponsa, Christ and his bride, the Church.
If we wanted to explain the fairytale personalistically, the attempt would founder on the fact that archetypes are not whimsical inventions but autonomous elements of the unconscious psyche which were there before any invention was thought ofThey represent the unalterable structure of a psychic world whose reality is attested by the determining effects it has upon the conscious mindThus, it is a significant psychic reality that the human pair is matched by another pair in the unconscious, the latter pair being only in appearance a reflection of the firstIn reality the royal pair invariably comes first, as an a priori, so that the human pair has far more the significance of an individual concretization, in space and time, of an eternal and primordial image—at least in its mental structure, which is imprinted upon the biological continuum.
We could say, then, that the swineherd stands for the animal man who has a soul-mate somewhere in the upper worldBy her royal birth she betrays her connection with the pre-existent, semidivine pairLooked at from this angle, the latter stands for everything a man can become if only he climbs high enough up the world-treeFor to the degree that the young swineherd gains possession of the patrician, feminine half of himself, he approximates to the pair of half-gods and lifts himself into the sphere of royalty, which means universal validityWe come across the same theme in Christian Rosencreutz's Chymical Wedding, where the king's son must first free his bride from the power of a Moor, to whom she has voluntarily given herself as a concubineThe Moor represents the alchemical nigredo in which the arcane substance lies hidden, an idea that forms yet another parallel to our mythologem, or, as we would say in psychological language, another variant of this archetype.
As in alchemy, our fairytale describes the unconscious processes that compensate the conscious, Christian situationIt depicts the workings of a spirit who carries our Christian thinking beyond the boundaries set by ecclesiastical concepts, seeking an answer to questions which neither the Middle Ages nor the present day have been able to solveIt is not difficult to see in the image of the second royal pair a correspondence to the ecclesiastical conception of bridegroom and bride, and in that of the hunter and witch a distortion of it, veering towards an atavistic, unconscious WotanismThe fact that it is a German fairytale makes the position particularly interesting, since this same Wotanism was the psychological godfather of National Socialism, a phenomenon which carried the distortion to the lowest pitch before the eyes of the worldOn the other hand, the fairytale makes it clear that it is possible for a man to attain totality, to become whole, only with the co-operation of the spirit of darkness, indeed that the latter is actually a causa instrumentalis of redemption and individuationIn utter perversion of this goal of spiritual development, to which all nature aspires and which is also prefigured in Christian doctrine, National Socialism destroyed man's moral autonomy and set up the nonsensical totalitarianism of the StateThe fairytale tells us how to proceed if we want to overcome the power of darkness: we must turn his own weapons against him, which naturally cannot be done if the magical underworld of the hunter remains unconscious, and if the best men in the nation would rather preach dogmatisms and platitudes than take the human psyche seriously.
When we consider the spirit in its archetypal form as it appears to us in fairytales and dreams, it presents a picture that differs strangely from the conscious idea of spirit, which is split up into so many meaningsSpirit was originally a spirit in human or animal form, a daimonion that came upon man from withoutBut our material already shows traces of an expansion of consciousness which has gradually begun to occupy that originally unconscious territory and to transform those daimonia, at least partially, into voluntary actsMan conquers not only nature, but spirit also, without realizing what he is doingTo the man of enlightened intellect it seems like the correction of a fallacy when he recognizes that what he took to be spirits is simply the human spirit and ultimately his own spiritAll the superhuman things, whether good or bad, that former ages predicated of the daimonia, are reduced to reasonable proportions as though they were pure exaggeration, and everything seems to be in the best possible orderBut were the unanimous convictions of the past really and truly only exaggerations? If they were not, then the integration of the spirit means nothing less than its demonization, since the superhuman spiritual agencies that were formerly tied up in nature are introjected into human nature, thus endowing it with a power which extends the bounds of the personality ad infinitum, in the most perilous wayI put it to the enlightened rationalist: has his rational reduction led to the beneficial control of matter and spirit? He will point proudly to the advances in physics and medicine, to the freeing of the mind from medieval stupidity and—as a well-meaning Christian—to our deliverance from the fear of demonsBut we continue to ask: what have all our other cultural achievements led to? The fearful answer is there before our eyes: man has been delivered from no fear, a hideous nightmare lies upon the worldSo far reason has failed lamentably, and the very thing that everybody wanted to avoid rolls on in ghastly progressionMan has achieved a wealth of useful gadgets, but, to offset that, he has torn open the abyss, and what will become of him now—where can he make a halt? After the last World War we hoped for reason: we go on hopingBut already we are fascinated by the possibilities of atomic fission and promise ourselves a Golden Age—the surest guarantee that the abomination of desolation will grow to limitless dimensionsAnd who or what is it that causes all this? It is none other than that harmless (!), ingenious, inventive, and sweetly reasonable human spirit who unfortunately is abysmally unconscious of the demonism that still clings to himWorse, this spirit does everything to avoid looking himself in the face, and we all help him like madOnly, heaven preserve us from psychology—that depravity might lead to self-knowledge I Rather let us have wars, for which somebody else is always to blame, nobody seeing that all the world is driven to do just what all the world flees from in terror.
It seems to me, frankly, that former ages did not exaggerate, that the spirit has not sloughed off its demonisms, and that mankind, because of its scientific and technological development, has in increasing measure delivered itself over to the danger of possessionTrue, the archetype of the spirit is capable of working for good as well as for evil, but it depends upon man's free—i.e., conscious—decision whether the good also will be perverted into something satanicMan's worst sin is unconsciousness, but it is indulged in with the greatest piety even by those who should serve mankind as teachers and examplesWhen shall we stop taking man for granted in this barbarous manner and in all seriousness seek ways and means to exorcize him, to rescue him from possession and unconsciousness, and make this the most vital task of civilization? Can we not understand that all the outward tinkerings and improvements do not touch man's inner nature, and that everything ultimately depends upon whether the man who wields the science and the technics is capable of responsibility or not? Christianity has shown us the way, but, as the facts bear witness, it has not penetrated deeply enough below the surfaceWhat depths of despair are still needed to open the eyes of the world's responsible leaders, so that at least they can refrain from leading themselves into temptation?
It is no light task for me to write about the figure of the trickster in American Indian mythology within the confined space of a commentaryWhen I first came across Adolf Bandelier's classic on this subject, The Delight Makers, many years ago, I was struck by the European analogy of the carnival in the medieval Church, with its reversal of the hierarchic order, which is still continued in the carnivals held by student societies todaySomething of this contradictoriness also inheres in the medieval description of the devil as simia dei (the ape of God), and in his characterization in folklore as the simpleton who is fooled or cheated. A curious combination of typical trickster motifs can be found in the alchemical figure of Mercurius; for instance, his fondness for sly jokes and malicious pranks, his powers as a shape-shifter, his dual nature, half animal, half divine, his exposure to all kinds of tortures, and—last but not least—his approximation to the figure of a saviourThese qualities make Mercurius seem like a daemonic being resurrected from primitive times, older even than the Greek HermesHis rogueries relate him in some measure to various figures met with in folklore and universally known in fairytales: Tom Thumb, Stupid Hans, or the buffoon-like Hanswurst, who is an altogether negative hero and yet manages to achieve through his stupidity what others fail to accomplish with their best effortsIn Grimm's fairytale, the Spirit Mercurius lets himself be outwitted by a peasant lad, and then has to buy his freedom with the precious gift of healing.
Since all mythical figures correspond to inner psychic experiences and originally sprang from them, it is not surprising to find certain phenomena in the field of parapsychology which remind us of the tricksterThese are the phenomena connected with poltergeists, and they occur at all times and places in the ambience of pre-adolescent childrenThe malicious tricks played by the poltergeist are as well known as the low level of his intelligence and the fatuity of his communications. Ability to change his shape seems also to be one of his characteristics, as there are not a few reports of his appearance in animal formSince he has on occasion described himself as a soul in hell, the motif of subjective suffering would seem not to be lacking eitherHis universality is co-extensive, so to speak, with that of shamanism, to which, as we know, the whole phenomenology of spiritualism belongsThere is something of the trickster in the character of the shaman and medicine-man, for he, too, often plays malicious jokes on people, only to fall victim in his turn to the vengeance of those whom he has injuredFor this reason, his profession sometimes puts him in peril of his lifeBesides that, the shamanistic techniques in themselves often cause the medicine-man a good deal of discomfort, if not actual painAt all events the making of a medicine-man involves, in many parts of the world, so much agony of body and soul that permanent psychic injuries may resultHis approximation to the saviour is an obvious consequence of this, in confirmation of the mythological truth that the wounded wounder is the agent of healing, and that the sufferer takes away suffering.
These mythological features extend even to the highest regions of man's spiritual developmentIf we consider, for example, the daemonic features exhibited by Yahweh in the Old Testament, we shall find in them not a few reminders of the unpredictable behaviour of the trickster, of his senseless orgies of destruction and his self-imposed sufferings, together with the same gradual development into a saviour and his simultaneous humanizationIt is just this transformation of the meaningless into the meaningful that reveals the trickster's compensatory relation to the saint. In the early Middle Ages, this led to some strange ecclesiastical customs based on memories of the ancient saturnaliaMostly they were celebrated on the days immediately following the birth of Christ—that is, in the New Year—with singing and dancingThe dances were the originally harmless tripudia of the priests, lower clergy, children, and subdeacons and took place in churchAn episcopus puerorum (children's bishop) was elected on Innocents' Day and dressed in pontifical robesAmid uproarious rejoicings he paid an official visit to the palace of the archbishop and bestowed the episcopal blessing from one of the windowsThe same thing happened at the tripudium hypodiaconorum, and at the dances for other priestly gradesBy the end of the twelfth century, the subdeacons' dance had degenerated into a real festum stultorum (fools' feast)A report from the year  says that at the Feast of the Circumcision in Notre Dame, Paris, so many abominations and shameful deeds were committed that the holy place was desecrated not only by smutty jokes, but even by the shedding of blood. In vain did Pope Innocent III inveigh against the jests and madness that make the clergy a mockery, and the shameless frenzy of their play-acting. Two hundred and fifty years later (March , ), a letter from the Theological Faculty of Paris to all the French bishops was still fulminating against these festivals, at which even the priests and clerics elected an archbishop or a bishop or pope, and named him the Fools' Pope (fatuorum papam)In the very midst of divine service masqueraders with grotesque faces, disguised as women, lions, and mummers, performed their dances, sang indecent songs in the choir, ate their greasy food from a corner of the altar near the priest celebrating mass, got out their games of dice, burned a stinking incense made of old shoe leather, and ran and hopped about all over the church.
It is not surprising that this veritable witches' sabbath was uncommonly popular, and that it required considerable time and effort to free the Church from this pagan heritage.
In certain localities even the priests seem to have adhered to the libertas decembrica, as the Fools' Holiday was called, in spite (or perhaps because?) of the fact that the older level of consciousness could let itself rip on this happy occasion with all the wildness, wantonness, and irresponsibility of paganismThese ceremonies, which still reveal the spirit of the trickster in his original form, seem to have died out by the beginning of the sixteenth centuryAt any rate, the various conciliar decrees issued from  to  forbade only the festum puerorum and the election of an episcopus puerorum.
Finally, we must also mention in this connection the festum asinorum, which, so far as I know, was celebrated mainly in FranceAlthough considered a harmless festival in memory of Mary's flight into Egypt, it was celebrated in a somewhat curious manner which might easily have given rise to misunderstandingsIn Beauvais, the ass procession went right into the churchAt the conclusion of each part (Introit, Kyrie, Gloria, etc.) of the high mass that followed, the whole congregation brayed, that is, they all went Y-a like a donkey (hac modulatione hinham concludebantur)A codex dating apparently from the eleventh century says: At the end of the mass, instead of the words Ite missa est,' the priest shall bray three times (ter hinhamabit), and instead of the words Deo gratias,' the congregation shall answer Y-a' (hinham) three times.
Du Cange says that the more ridiculous this rite seemed, the greater the enthusiasm with which it was celebratedIn other places the ass was decked with a golden canopy whose corners were held by distinguished canons; the others present had to don suitably festive garments, as at Christmas. Since there were certain tendencies to bring the ass into symbolic relationship with Christ, and since, from ancient times, the god of the Jews was vulgarly conceived to be an ass—a prejudice which extended to Christ himself, as is shown by the mock crucifixion scratched on the wall of the Imperial Cadet School on the Palatine—the danger of theriomorphism lay uncomfortably closeEven the bishops could do nothing to stamp out this custom, until finally it had to be suppressed by the auctoritas supremi Senatus. The suspicion of blasphemy becomes quite open in Nietzsche's Ass Festival, which is a deliberately blasphemous parody of the mass.
These medieval customs demonstrate the role of the trickster to perfection, and, when they vanished from the precincts of the Church, they appeared again on the profane level of Italian theatricals, as those comic types who, often adorned with enormous ithyphallic emblems, entertained the far from prudish public with ribaldries in true Rabelaisian styleCallot's engravings have preserved these classical figures for posterity—the Pulcinellas, Cucorognas, Chico Sgarras, and the like.
In picaresque tales, in carnivals and revels, in magic rites of healing, in man's religious fears and exaltations, this phantom of the trickster haunts the mythology of all ages, sometimes in quite unmistakable form, sometimes in strangely modulated guiseHe is obviously a psychologem, an archetypal psychic structure of extreme antiquityIn his clearest manifestations he is a faithful reflection of an absolutely undifferentiated human consciousness, corresponding to a psyche that has hardly left the animal levelThat this is how the trickster figure originated can hardly be contested if we look at it from the causal and historical angleIn psychology as in biology we cannot afford to overlook or underestimate this question of origins, although the answer usually tells us nothing about the functional meaningFor this reason biology should never forget the question of purpose, for only by answering that can we get at the meaning of a phenomenonEven in pathology, where we are concerned with lesions which have no meaning in themselves, the exclusively causal approach proves to be inadequate, since there are a number of pathological phenomena which only give up their meaning when we inquire into their purposeAnd where we are concerned with the normal phenomena of life, this question of purpose takes undisputed precedence.
When, therefore, a primitive or barbarous consciousness forms a picture of itself on a much earlier level of development and continues to do so for hundreds or even thousands of years, undeterred by the contamination of its archaic qualities with differentiated, highly developed mental products, then the causal explanation is that the older the archaic qualities are, the more conservative and pertinacious is their behaviourOne simply cannot shake off the memory-image of things as they were, and drags it along like a senseless appendage.
This explanation, which is facile enough to satisfy the rationalistic requirements of our age, would certainly not meet with the approval of the Winnebagos, the nearest possessors of the trickster cycleFor them the myth is not in any sense a remnant—it is far too amusing for that, and an object of undivided enjoymentFor them it still functions, provided that they have not been spoiled by civilizationFor them there is no earthly reason to theorize about the meaning and purpose of myths, just as the Christmas-tree seems no problem at all to the naïve EuropeanFor the thoughtful observer, however, both trickster and Christmas-tree afford reason enough for reflectionNaturally it depends very much on the mentality of the observer what he thinks about these thingsConsidering the crude primitivity of the trickster cycle, it would not be surprising if one saw in this myth simply the reflection of an earlier, rudimentary stage of consciousness, which is what the trickster obviously seems to be.
The only question that would need answering is whether such personified reflections exist at all in empirical psychologyAs a matter of fact they do, and these experiences of split or double personality actually form the core of the earliest psychopathological investigationsThe peculiar thing about these dissociations is that the split-off personality is not just a random one, but stands in a complementary or compensatory relationship to the ego-personalityIt is a personification of traits of character which are sometimes worse and sometimes better than those the ego-personality possessesA collective personification like the trickster is the product of an aggregate of individuals and is welcomed by each individual as something known to him, which would not be the case if it were just an individual outgrowth.
Now if the myth were nothing but an historical remnant, one would have to ask why it has not long since vanished into the great rubbish-heap of the past, and why it continues to make its influence felt on the highest levels of civilization, even where, on account of his stupidity and grotesque scurrility, the trickster no longer plays the role of a delight-maker. In many cultures his figure seems like an old river-bed in which the water still flowsOne can see this best of all from the fact that the trickster motif does not crop up only in its mythical form but appears just as naïvely and authentically in the unsuspecting modern man—whenever, in fact, he feels himself at the mercy of annoying accidents which thwart his will and his actions with apparently malicious intentHe then speaks of hoodoos and jinxes or of the mischievousness of the object. Here the trickster is represented by counter-tendencies in the unconscious, and in certain cases by a sort of second personality, of a puerile and inferior character, not unlike the personalities who announce themselves at spiritualistic séances and cause all those ineffably childish phenomena so typical of poltergeistsI have, I think, found a suitable designation for this character-component when I called it the shadowOn the civilized level, it is regarded as a personal gaffe, slip, faux pas, etc., which are then chalked up as defects of the conscious personalityWe are no longer aware that in carnival customs and the like there are remnants of a collective shadow figure which prove that the personal shadow is in part descended from a numinous collective figureThis collective figure gradually breaks up under the impact of civilization, leaving traces in folklore which are difficult to recognizeBut the main part of him gets personalized and is made an object of personal responsibility.
Radin's trickster cycle preserves the shadow in its pristine mythological form, and thus points back to a very much earlier stage of consciousness which existed before the birth of the myth, when the Indian was still groping about in a similar mental darknessOnly when his consciousness reached a higher level could he detach the earlier state from himself and objectify it, that is, say anything about itSo long as his consciousness was itself trickster-like, such a confrontation could obviously not take placeIt was possible only when the attainment of a newer and higher level of consciousness enabled him to look back on a lower and inferior stateIt was only to be expected that a good deal of mockery and contempt should mingle with this retrospect, thus casting an even thicker pall over man's memories of the past, which were pretty unedifying anywayThis phenomenon must have repeated itself innumerable times in the history of his mental developmentThe sovereign contempt with which our modern age looks back on the taste and intelligence of earlier centuries is a classic example of this, and there is an unmistakable allusion to the same phenomenon in the New Testament, where we are told in Acts : that God looked down from above (υπєριδῴυ, despiciens) on the Χρóυoí τῆς ἀγυοíας, the times of ignorance (or unconsciousness).
This attitude contrasts strangely with the still commoner and more striking idealization of the past, which is praised not merely as the good old days but as the Golden Age—and not just by uneducated and superstitious people, but by all those legions of theosophical enthusiasts who resolutely believe in the former existence and lofty civilization of Atlantis.
Anyone who belongs to a sphere of culture that seeks the perfect state somewhere in the past must feel very queerly indeed when confronted by the figure of the tricksterHe is a forerunner of the saviour, and, like him, God, man, and animal at onceHe is both subhuman and superhuman, a bestial and divine being, whose chief and most alarming characteristic is his unconsciousnessBecause of it he is deserted by his (evidently human) companions, which seems to indicate that he has fallen below their level of consciousnessHe is so unconscious of himself that his body is not a unity, and his two hands fight each otherHe takes his anus off and entrusts it with a special taskEven his sex is optional despite its phallic qualities: he can turn himself into a woman and bear childrenFrom his penis he makes all kinds of useful plantsThis is a reference to his original nature as a Creator, for the world is made from the body of a god.
On the other hand he is in many respects stupider than the animals, and gets into one ridiculous scrape after anotherAlthough he is not really evil, he does the most atrocious things from sheer unconsciousness and unrelatednessHis imprisonment in animal unconsciousness is suggested by the episode where he gets his head caught inside the skull of an elk, and the next episode shows how he overcomes this condition by imprisoning the head of a hawk inside his own rectumTrue, he sinks back into the former condition immediately afterwards, by falling under the ice, and is outwitted time after time by the animals, but in the end he succeeds in tricking the cunning coyote, and this brings back to him his saviour natureThe trickster is a primitive cosmic being of divine-animal nature, on the one hand superior to man because of his superhuman qualities, and on the other hand inferior to him because of his unreason and unconsciousnessHe is no match for the animals either, because of his extraordinary clumsiness and lack of instinctThese defects are the marks of his human nature, which is not so well adapted to the environment as the animal's but, instead, has prospects of a much higher development of consciousness based on a considerable eagerness to learn, as is duly emphasized in the myth.
What the repeated telling of the myth signifies is the therapeutic anamnesis of contents which, for reasons still to be discussed, should never be forgotten for longIf they were nothing but the remnants of an inferior state it would be understandable if man turned his attention away from them, feeling that their reappearance was a nuisanceThis is evidently by no means the case, since the trickster has been a source of amusement right down to civilized times, where he can still be recognized in the carnival figures of Pulcinella and the clownThat is one important reason for his still continuing to functionBut it is not the only one, and certainly not the reason why this reflection of an extremely primitive state of consciousness solidified into a mythological personageMere vestiges of an early state that is dying out usually lose their energy at an increasing rate, otherwise they would never disappearThe last thing we would expect is that they would have the strength to solidify into a mythological figure with its own cycle of legends—unless, of course, they received energy from outside, in this case from a higher level of consciousness or from sources in the unconscious which are not yet exhaustedTo take a legitimate parallel from the psychology of the individual, namely the appearance of an impressive shadow figure antagonistically confronting a personal consciousness: this figure does not appear merely because it still exists in the individual, but because it rests on a dynamism whose existence can only be explained in terms of his actual situation, for instance because the shadow is so disagreeable to his ego-consciousness that it has to be repressed into the unconsciousThis explanation does not quite meet the case here, because the trickster obviously represents a vanishing level of consciousness which increasingly lacks the power to take express and assert itselfFurthermore, repression would prevent it from vanishing, because repressed contents are the very ones that have the best chance of survival, as we know from experience that nothing is corrected in the unconsciousLastly, the story of the trickster is not in the least disagreeable to the Winnebago consciousness or incompatible with it but, on the contrary, pleasurable and therefore not conducive to repressionIt looks, therefore, as if the myth were actively sustained and fostered by consciousnessThis may well be so, since that is the best and most successful method of keeping the shadow figure conscious and subjecting it to conscious criticismAlthough, to begin with, this criticism has more the character of a positive evaluation, we may expect that with the progressive development of consciousness the cruder aspects of the myth will gradually fall away, even if the danger of its rapid disappearance under the stress of white civilization did not existWe have often seen how certain customs, originally cruel or obscene, became mere vestiges in the course of time.
The process of rendering this motif harmless takes an extremely long time, as its history shows; one can still detect traces of it even at a high level of civilizationIts longevity could also be explained by the strength and vitality of the state of consciousness described in the myth, and by the secret attraction and fascination this has for the conscious mindAlthough purely causal hypotheses in the biological sphere are not as a rule very satisfactory, due weight must nevertheless be given to the fact that in the case of the trickster a higher level of consciousness has covered up a lower one, and that the latter was already in retreatHis recollection, however, is mainly due to the interest which the conscious mind brings to bear on him, the inevitable concomitant being, as we have seen, the gradual civilizing, i.e., assimilation, of a primitive daemonic figure who was originally autonomous and even capable of causing possession.
To supplement the causal approach by a final one therefore enables us to arrive at more meaningful interpretations not only in medical psychology, where we are concerned with individual fantasies originating in the unconscious, but also in the case of collective fantasies, that is myths and fairytales.
As Radin points out, the civilizing process begins within the framework of the trickster cycle itself, and this is a clear indication that the original state has been overcomeAt any rate the marks of deepest unconsciousness fall away from him; instead of acting in a brutal, savage, stupid, and senseless fashion, the trickster's behaviour towards the end of the cycle becomes quite useful and sensibleThe devaluation of his earlier unconsciousness is apparent even in the myth, and one wonders what has happened to his evil qualitiesThe naïve reader may imagine that when the dark aspects disappear they are no longer there in realityBut that is not the case at all, as experience showsWhat actually happens is that the conscious mind is then able to free itself from the fascination of evil and is no longer obliged to live it compulsivelyThe darkness and the evil have not gone up in smoke, they have merely withdrawn into the unconscious owing to loss of energy, where they remain unconscious so long as all is well with the consciousBut if the conscious should find itself in a critical or doubtful situation, then it soon becomes apparent that the shadow has not dissolved into nothing but is only waiting for a favourable opportunity to reappear as a projection upon one's neighbourIf this trick is successful, there is immediately created between them that world of primordial darkness where everything that is characteristic of the trickster can happen—even on the highest plane of civilizationThe best examples of these monkey tricks, as popular speech aptly and truthfully sums up this state of affairs in which everything goes wrong and nothing intelligent happens except by mistake at the last moment, are naturally to be found in politics.
The so-called civilized man has forgotten the tricksterHe remembers him only figuratively and metaphorically, when, irritated by his own ineptitude, he speaks of fate playing tricks on him or of things being bewitchedHe never suspects that his own hidden and apparently harmless shadow has qualities whose dangerousness exceeds his wildest dreamsAs soon as people get together in masses and submerge the individual, the shadow is mobilized, and, as history shows, may even be personified and incarnated.
The disastrous idea that everything comes to the human psyche from outside and that it is born a tabula rasa is responsible for the erroneous belief that under normal circumstances the individual is in perfect orderHe then looks to the State for salvation, and makes society pay for his inefficiencyHe thinks the meaning of existence would be discovered if food and clothing were delivered to him gratis on his own doorstep, or if everybody possessed an automobileSuch are the puerilities that rise up in place of an unconscious shadow and keep it unconsciousAs a result of these prejudices, the individual feels totally dependent on his environment and loses all capacity for introspectionIn this way his code of ethics is replaced by a knowledge of what is permitted or forbidden or orderedHow, under these circumstances, can one expect a soldier to subject an order received from a superior to ethical scrutiny? He has not yet made the discovery that he might be capable of spontaneous ethical impulses, and of performing them—even when no one is looking.
From this point of view we can see why the myth of the trickster was preserved and developed: like many other myths, it was supposed to have a therapeutic effectIt holds the earlier low intellectual and moral level before the eyes of the more highly developed individual, so that he shall not forget how things looked yesterdayWe like to imagine that something which we do not understand does not help us in any wayBut that is not always soSeldom does a man understand with his head alone, least of all when he is a primitiveBecause of its numinosity the myth has a direct effect on the unconscious, no matter whether it is understood or notThe fact that its repeated telling has not long since become obsolete can, I believe, be explained by its usefulnessThe explanation is rather difficult because two contrary tendencies are at work: the desire on the one hand to get out of the earlier condition and on the other hand not to forget itApparently Radin has also felt this difficulty, for he says: Viewed psychologically, it might be contended that the history of civilization is largely the account of the attempts of man to forget his transformation from an animal into a human being. A few pages further on he says (with reference to the Golden Age): So stubborn a refusal to forget is not an accident. And it is also no accident that we are forced to contradict ourselves as soon as we try to formulate man's paradoxical attitude to mythEven the most enlightened of us will set up a Christmas-tree for his children without having the least idea what this custom means, and is invariably disposed to nip any attempt at interpretation in the budIt is really astonishing to see how many so-called superstitions are rampant nowadays in town and country alike, but if one took hold of the individual and asked him, loudly and clearly, Do you believe in ghosts? in witches? in spells and magic? he would deny it indignantlyIt is a hundred to one he has never heard of such things and thinks it all rubbishBut in secret he is all for it, just like a jungle-dwellerThe public knows very little of these things anyway, for everyone is convinced that in our enlightened society that kind of superstition has long since been eradicated, and it is part of the general convention to act as though one had never heard of such things, not to mention believing in them.
But nothing is ever lost, not even the blood pact with the devilOutwardly it is forgotten, but inwardly not at allWe act like the natives on the southern slopes of Mount Elgon, in East Africa, one of whom accompanied me part of the way into the bushAt a fork in the path we came upon a brand new ghost trap, beautifully got up like a little hut, near the cave where he lived with his familyI asked him if he had made itHe denied it with all the signs of extreme agitation, asserting that only children would make such a ju-ju. Whereupon he gave the hut a kick, and the whole thing fell to pieces.
This is exactly the reaction we can observe in Europe todayOutwardly people are more or less civilized, but inwardly they are still primitivesSomething in man is profoundly disinclined to give up his beginnings, and something else believes it has long since got beyond all thatThis contradiction was once brought home to me in the most drastic manner when I was watching a Strudel (a sort of local witch-doctor) taking the spell off a stableThe stable was situated immediately beside the Gotthard railway line, and several international expresses sped past during the ceremonyTheir occupants would hardly have suspected that a primitive ritual was being performed a few yards away.
The conflict between the two dimensions of consciousness is simply an expression of the polaristic structure of the psyche, which like any other energic system is dependent on the tension of oppositesThat is also why there are no general psychological propositions which could not just as well be reversed; indeed, their reversibility proves their validityWe should never forget that in any psychological discussion we are not saying anything about the psyche, but that the psyche is always speaking about itselfIt is no use thinking we can ever get beyond the psyche by means of the mind, even though the mind asserts that it is not dependent on the psycheHow could it prove that? We can say, if we like, that one statement comes from the psyche, is psychic and nothing but psychic, and that another comes from the mind, is spiritual and therefore superior to the psychic oneBoth are mere assertions based on the postulates of belief.
The fact is, that this old trichotomous hierarchy of psychic contents (hylic, psychic, and pneumatic) represents the polaristic structure of the psyche, which is the only immediate object of experienceThe unity of our psychic nature lies in the middle, just as the living unity of the waterfall appears in the dynamic connection between above and belowThus, the living effect of the myth is experienced when a higher consciousness, rejoicing in its freedom and independence, is confronted by the autonomy of a mythological figure and yet cannot flee from its fascination, but must pay tribute to the overwhelming impressionThe figure works, because secretly it participates in the observer's psyche and appears as its reflection, though it is not recognized as suchIt is split off from his consciousness and consequently behaves like an autonomous personalityThe trickster is a collective shadow figure, a summation of all the inferior traits of character in individualsAnd since the individual shadow is never absent as a component of personality, the collective figure can construct itself out of it continuallyNot always, of course, as a mythological figure, but, in consequence of the increasing repression and neglect of the original mythologems, as a corresponding projection on other social groups and nations.
If we take the trickster as a parallel of the individual shadow, then the question arises whether that trend towards meaning, which we saw in the trickster myth, can also be observed in the subjective and personal shadowSince this shadow frequently appears in the phenomenology of dreams as a well-defined figure, we can answer this question positively: the shadow, although by definition a negative figure, sometimes has certain clearly discernible traits and associations which point to a quite different backgroundIt is as though he were hiding meaningful contents under an unprepossessing exteriorExperience confirms this; and what is more important, the things that are hidden usually consist of increasingly numinous figuresThe one standing closest behind the shadow is the anima, who is endowed with considerable powers of fascination and possessionShe often appears in rather too youthful form, and hides in her turn the powerful archetype of the wise old man (sage, magician, king, etc.)The series could be extended, but it would be pointless to do so, as psychologically one only understands what one has experienced oneselfThe concepts of complex psychology are, in essence, not intellectual formulations but names for certain areas of experience, and though they can be described they remain dead and irrepresentable to anyone who has not experienced themThus, I have noticed that people usually have not much difficulty in picturing to themselves what is meant by the shadow, even if they would have preferred instead a bit of Latin or Greek jargon that sounds more scientific. But it costs them enormous difficulties to understand what the anima isThey accept her easily enough when she appears in novels or as a film star, but she is not understood at all when it comes to seeing the role she plays in their own lives, because she sums up everything that a man can never get the better of and never finishes coping withTherefore it remains in a perpetual state of emotionality which must not be touchedThe degree of unconsciousness one meets with in this connection is, to put it mildly, astoundingHence it is practically impossible to get a man who is afraid of his own femininity to understand what is meant by the anima.
Actually, it is not surprising that this should be so, since even the most rudimentary insight into the shadow sometimes causes the greatest difficulties for the modern EuropeanBut since the shadow is the figure nearest his consciousness and the least explosive one, it is also the first component of personality to come up in an analysis of the unconsciousA minatory and ridiculous figure, he stands at the very beginning of the way of individuation, posing the deceptively easy riddle of the Sphinx, or grimly demanding answer to a quaestio crocodilina.
If, at the end of the trickster myth, the saviour is hinted at, this comforting premonition or hope means that some calamity or other has happened and been consciously understoodOnly out of disaster can the longing for the saviour arise—in other words, the recognition and unavoidable integration of the shadow create such a harrowing situation that nobody but a saviour can undo the tangled web of fateIn the case of the individual, the problem constellated by the shadow is answered on the plane of the anima, that is, through relatednessIn the history of the collective as in the history of the individual, everything depends on the development of consciousnessThis gradually brings liberation from imprisonment in ἀγνοία, unconsciousness,' and is therefore a bringer of light as well as of healing.
As in its collective, mythological form, so also the individual shadow contains within it the seed of an enantiodromia, of a conversion into its opposite.
The relation between the conscious and the unconscious on the one hand, and the individuation process on the other, are problems that arise almost regularly during the later stages of analytical treatmentBy analytical I mean a procedure that takes account of the existence of the unconsciousThese problems do not arise in a procedure based on suggestionA few preliminary words may not be out of place in order to explain what is meant by individuation.
I use the term individuation to denote the process by which a person becomes a psychological in-dividual, that is, a separate, indivisible unity or whole. It is generally assumed that consciousness is the whole of the psychological individualBut knowledge of the phenomena that can only be explained on the hypothesis of unconscious psychic processes makes it doubtful whether the ego and its contents are in fact identical with the whole. If unconscious processes exist at all, they must surely belong to the totality of the individual, even though they are not components of the conscious egoIf they were part of the ego they would necessarily be conscious, because everything that is directly related to the ego is consciousConsciousness can even be equated with the relation between the ego and the psychic contentsBut unconscious phenomena are so little related to the ego that most people do not hesitate to deny their existence outrightNevertheless, they manifest themselves in an individual's behaviourAn attentive observer can detect them without difficulty, while the observed person remains quite unaware of the fact that he is betraying his most secret thoughts or even things he has never thought consciouslyIt is, however, a great prejudice to suppose that something we have never thought consciously does not exist in the psycheThere is plenty of evidence to show that consciousness is very far from covering the psyche in its totalityMany things occur semiconsciously, and a great many more remain entirely unconsciousThorough investigation of the phenomena of dual and multiple personalities, for instance, has brought to light a mass of material with observations to prove this point(I would refer the reader to the writings of Pierre Janet, Théodore Flournoy, Morton Prince, and others.)
The importance of such phenomena has made a deep impression on medical psychology, because they give rise to all sorts of psychic and physiological symptomsIn these circumstances, the assumption that the ego expresses the totality of the psyche has become untenableIt is, on the contrary, evident that the whole must necessarily include not only consciousness but the illimitable field of unconscious occurrences as well, and that the ego can be no more than the centre of the field of consciousness.
You will naturally ask whether the unconscious possesses a centre tooI would hardly venture to assume that there is in the unconscious a ruling principle analogous to the egoAs a matter of fact, everything points to the contraryIf there were such a centre, we could expect almost regular signs of its existenceCases of dual personality would then be frequent occurrences instead of rare curiositiesAs a rule, unconscious phenomena manifest themselves in fairly chaotic and unsystematic formDreams, for instance, show no apparent order and no tendency to systematization, as they would have to do if there were a personal consciousness at the back of themThe philosophers Carus and von Hartmann treat the unconscious as a metaphysical principle, a sort of universal mind, without any trace of personality or ego-consciousness, and similarly Schopenhauer's Will is without an egoModern psychologists, too, regard the unconscious as an egoless function below the threshold of consciousnessUnlike the philosophers, they tend to derive its subliminal functions from the conscious mindJanet thinks that there is a certain weakness of consciousness which is unable to hold all the psychic processes togetherFreud, on the other hand, favours the idea of conscious factors that suppress certain incompatible tendenciesMuch can be said for both theories, since there are numerous cases where a weakness of consciousness actually causes certain contents to fall below the threshold, or where disagreeable contents are repressedIt is obvious that such careful observers as Janet and Freud would not have constructed theories deriving the unconscious mainly from conscious sources had they been able to discover traces of an independent personality or of an autonomous will in the manifestations of the unconscious.
If it were true that the unconscious consists of nothing but contents accidentally deprived of consciousness but otherwise indistinguishable from the conscious material, then one could identify the ego more or less with the totality of the psycheBut actually the situation is not quite so simpleBoth theories are based mainly on observations in the field of neurosisNeither Janet nor Freud had any specifically psychiatric experienceIf they had, they would surely have been struck by the fact that the unconscious displays contents that are utterly different from conscious ones, so strange, indeed, that nobody can understand them, neither the patient himself nor his doctorsThe patient is inundated by a flood of thoughts that are as strange to him as they are to a normal personThat is why we call him crazy: we cannot understand his ideasWe understand something only if we have the necessary premises for doing soBut here the premises are just as remote from our consciousness as they were from the mind of the patient before he went madOtherwise he would never have become insane.
There is, in fact, no field directly known to us from which we could derive certain pathological ideasIt is not a question of more or less normal contents that became unconscious just by accidentThey are, on the contrary, products whose nature is at first completely bafflingThey differ in every respect from neurotic material, which cannot be said to be at all bizarreThe material of a neurosis is understandable in human terms, but that of a psychosis is not.
This peculiar psychotic material cannot be derived from the conscious mind, because the latter lacks the premises which would help to explain the strangeness of the ideasNeurotic contents can be integrated without appreciable injury to the ego, but psychotic ideas cannotThey remain inaccessible, and ego-consciousness is more or less swamped by themThey even show a distinct tendency to draw the ego into their system.
Such cases indicate that under certain conditions the unconscious is capable of taking over the role of the egoThe consequence of this exchange is insanity and confusion, because the unconscious is not a second personality with organized and centralized functions but in all probability a decentralized congeries of psychic processesHowever, nothing produced by the human mind lies absolutely outside the psychic realmEven the craziest idea must correspond to something in the psycheWe cannot suppose that certain minds contain elements that do not exist at all in other mindsNor can we assume that the unconscious is capable of becoming autonomous only in certain people, namely in those predisposed to insanityIt is very much more likely that the tendency to autonomy is a more or less general peculiarity of the unconsciousMental disorder is, in a sense, only one outstanding example of a hidden but none the less general conditionThis tendency to autonomy shows itself above all in affective states, including those of normal peopleWhen in a state of violent affect one says or does things which exceed the ordinaryNot much is needed: love and hate, joy and grief, are often enough to make the ego and the unconscious change placesVery strange ideas indeed can take possession of otherwise healthy people on such occasionsGroups, communities, and even whole nations can be seized in this way by psychic epidemics.
The autonomy of the unconscious therefore begins where emotions are generatedEmotions are instinctive, involuntary reactions which upset the rational order of consciousness by their elemental outburstsAffects are not made or wilfully produced; they simply happenIn a state of affect a trait of character sometimes appears which is strange even to the person concerned, or hidden contents may irrupt involuntarilyThe more violent an affect the closer it comes to the pathological, to a condition in which the ego-consciousness is thrust aside by autonomous contents that were unconscious beforeSo long as the unconscious is in a dormant condition, it seems as if there were absolutely nothing in this hidden regionHence we are continually surprised when something unknown suddenly appears from nowhere. Afterwards, of course, the psychologist comes along and shows that things had to happen as they did for this or that reasonBut who could have said so beforehand?
We call the unconscious nothing, and yet it is a reality in potentiaThe thought we shall think, the deed we shall do, even the fate we shall lament tomorrow, all lie unconscious in our todayThe unknown in us which the affect uncovers was always there and sooner or later would have presented itself to consciousnessHence we must always reckon with the presence of things not yet discoveredThese, as I have said, may be unknown quirks of characterBut possibilities of future development may also come to light in this way, perhaps in just such an outburst of affect which sometimes radically alters the whole situationThe unconscious has a Janus-face: on one side its contents point back to a preconscious, prehistoric world of instinct, while on the other side it potentially anticipates the future—precisely because of the instinctive readiness for action of the factors that determine man's fateIf we had complete knowledge of the ground plan lying dormant in an individual from the beginning, his fate would be in large measure predictable.
Now, to the extent that unconscious tendencies—be they backward-looking images or forward-looking anticipations—appear in dreams, dreams have been regarded, in all previous ages, less as historical regressions than as anticipations of the future, and rightly soFor everything that will be happens on the basis of what has been, and of what—consciously or unconsciously—still exists as a memory-traceIn so far as no man is born totally new, but continually repeats the stage of development last reached by the species, he contains unconsciously, as an a priori datum, the entire psychic structure developed both upwards and downwards by his ancestors in the course of the agesThat is what gives the unconscious its characteristic historical aspect, but it is at the same time the sine qua non for shaping the futureFor this reason it is often very difficult to decide whether an autonomous manifestation of the unconscious should be interpreted as an effect (and therefore historical) or as an aim (and therefore teleological and anticipatory)The conscious mind thinks as a rule without regard to ancestral preconditions and without taking into account the influence this a priori factor has on the shaping of the individual's fateWhereas we think in periods of years, the unconscious thinks and lives in terms of millenniaSo when something happens that seems to us an unexampled novelty, it is generally a very old story indeedWe still forget, like children, what happened yesterdayWe are still living in a wonderful new world where man thinks himself astonishingly new and modern. This is unmistakable proof of the youthfulness of human consciousness, which has not yet grown aware of its historical antecedents.
As a matter of fact, the normal person convinces me far more of the autonomy of the unconscious than does the insane personPsychiatric theory can always take refuge behind real or alleged organic disorders of the brain and thus detract from the importance of the unconsciousBut such a view is no longer applicable when it comes to normal humanityWhat one sees happening in the world is not just a shadowy vestige of activities that were once conscious, but the expression of a living psychic condition that still exists and always will existWere that not so, one might well be astonishedBut it is precisely those who give least credence to the autonomy of the unconscious who are the most surprised by itBecause of its youthfulness and vulnerability, our consciousness tends to make light of the unconsciousThis is understandable enough, for a young man should not let himself be overawed by the authority of his parents if he wants to start something on his own accountHistorically as well as individually, our consciousness has developed out of the darkness and somnolence of primordial unconsciousnessThere were psychic processes and functions long before any ego-consciousness existedThinking existed long before man was able to say: I am conscious of thinking.
The primitive perils of the soul consist mainly of dangers to consciousnessFascination, bewitchment, loss of soul, possession, etcare obviously phenomena of the dissociation and suppression of consciousness caused by unconscious contentsEven civilized man is not yet entirely free of the darkness of primeval timesThe unconscious is the mother of consciousnessWhere there is a mother there is also a father, yet he seems to be unknownConsciousness, in the pride of its youth, may deny its father, but it cannot deny its motherThat would be too unnatural, for one can see in every child how hesitantly and slowly its ego-consciousness evolves out of a fragmentary consciousness lasting for single moments only, and how these islands gradually emerge from the total darkness of mere instinctuality.
Consciousness grows out of an unconscious psyche which is older than it, and which goes on functioning together with it or even in spite of itAlthough there are numerous cases of conscious contents becoming unconscious again (through being repressed, for instance), the unconscious as a whole is far from being a mere remnant of consciousnessOr are the psychic functions of animals remnants of consciousness?
As I have said, there is little hope of our finding in the unconscious an order equivalent to that of the egoIt certainly does not look as if we were likely to discover an unconscious ego-personality, something in the nature of a Pythagorean counter-earth. Nevertheless, we cannot overlook the fact that, just as consciousness arises from the unconscious, the ego-centre, too, crystallizes out of a dark depth in which it was somehow contained in potentiaJust as a human mother can only produce a human child, whose deepest nature lay hidden during its potential existence within her, so we are practically compelled to believe that the unconscious cannot be an entirely chaotic accumulation of instincts and imagesThere must be something to hold it together and give expression to the wholeIts centre cannot possibly be the ego, since the ego was born out of it into consciousness and turns its back on the unconscious, seeking to shut it out as much as possibleOr can it be that the unconscious loses its centre with the birth of the ego? In that case we would expect the ego to be far superior to the unconscious in influence and importanceThe unconscious would then follow meekly in the footsteps of the conscious, and that would be just what we wish.
Unfortunately, the facts show the exact opposite: consciousness succumbs all too easily to unconscious influences, and these are often truer and wiser than our conscious thinkingAlso, it frequently happens that unconscious motives overrule our conscious decisions, especially in matters of vital importanceIndeed, the fate of the individual is largely dependent on unconscious factorsCareful investigation shows how very much our conscious decisions depend on the undisturbed functioning of memoryBut memory often suffers from the disturbing interference of unconscious contentsMoreover, it functions as a rule automaticallyOrdinarily it uses the bridges of association, but often in such an extraordinary way that another thorough investigation of the whole process of memory-reproduction is needed in order to find out how certain memories managed to reach consciousness at allAnd sometimes these bridges cannot be foundIn such cases it is impossible to dismiss the hypothesis of the spontaneous activity of the unconsciousAnother example is intuition, which is chiefly dependent on unconscious processes of a very complex natureBecause of this peculiarity, I have defined intuition as perception via the unconscious.
Normally the unconscious collaborates with the conscious without friction or disturbance, so that one is not even aware of its existenceBut when an individual or a social group deviates too far from their instinctual foundations, they then experience the full impact of unconscious forcesThe collaboration of the unconscious is intelligent and purposive, and even when it acts in opposition to consciousness its expression is still compensatory in an intelligent way, as if it were trying to restore the lost balance.
There are dreams and visions of such an impressive chararacter that some people refuse to admit that they could have originated in an unconscious psycheThey prefer to assume that such phenomena derive from a sort of superconsciousness. Such people make a distinction between a quasi-physiological or instinctive unconscious and a psychic sphere or layer above consciousness, which they style the superconscious. As a matter of fact, this psyche, which in Indian philosophy is called the higher consciousness, corresponds to what we in the West call the unconscious. Certain dreams, visions, and mystical experiences do, however, suggest the existence of a consciousness in the unconsciousBut, if we assume a consciousness in the unconscious, we are at once faced with the difficulty that no consciousness can exist without a subject, that is, an ego to which the contents are relatedConsciousness needs a centre, an ego to which something is consciousWe know of no other kind of consciousness, nor can we imagine a consciousness without an egoThere can be no consciousness when there is no one to say: I am conscious.
It is unprofitable to speculate about things we cannot knowI therefore refrain from making assertions that go beyond the bounds of scienceIt was never possible for me to discover in the unconscious anything like a personality comparable with the egoBut although a second ego cannot be discovered (except in the rare cases of dual personality), the manifestations of the unconscious do at least show traces of personalitiesA simple example is the dream, where a number of real or imaginary people represent the dream-thoughtsIn nearly all the important types of dissociation, the manifestations of the unconscious assume a strikingly personal formCareful examination of the behaviour and mental content of these personifications, however, reveals their fragmentary characterThey seem to represent complexes that have split off from a greater whole, and are the very reverse of a personal centre of the unconscious.
I have always been greatly impressed by the character of dissociated fragments as personalitiesHence I have often asked myself whether we are not justified in assuming that, if such fragments have personality, the whole from which they were broken off must have personality to an even higher degreeThe inference seemed logical, since it does not depend on whether the fragments are large or smallWhy, then, should not the whole have personality too? Personality need not imply consciousnessIt can just as easily be dormant or dreaming.
The general aspect of unconscious manifestations is in the main chaotic and irrational, despite certain symptoms of intelligence and purposivenessThe unconscious produces dreams, visions, fantasies, emotions, grotesque ideas, and so forthThis is exactly what we would expect a dreaming personality to doIt seems to be a personality that was never awake and was never conscious of the life it had lived and of its own continuityThe only question is whether the hypothesis of a dormant and hidden personality is possible or notIt may be that all of the personality to be found in the unconscious is contained in the fragmentary personifications mentioned beforeSince this is very possible, all my conjectures would be in vain—unless there were evidence of much less fragmentary and more complete personalities, even though they are hidden.
I am convinced that such evidence existsUnfortunately, the material to prove this belongs to the subtleties of psychological analysisIt is therefore not exactly easy to give the reader a simple and convincing idea of it.
I shall begin with a brief statement: in the unconscious of every man there is hidden a feminine personality, and in that of every woman a masculine personality.
It is a well-known fact that sex is determined by a majority of male or female genes, as the case may beBut the minority of genes belonging to the other sex does not simply disappearA man therefore has in him a feminine side, an unconscious feminine figure—a fact of which he is generally quite unawareI may take it as known that I have called this figure the anima, and its counterpart in a woman the animus. In order not to repeat myself, I must refer the reader to the literatureThis figure frequently appears in dreams, where one can observe all the attributes I have mentioned in earlier publications.
Another, no less important and clearly defined figure is the shadow. Like the anima, it appears either in projection on suitable persons, or personified as such in dreamsThe shadow coincides with the personal unconscious (which corresponds to Freud's conception of the unconscious)Again like the anima, this figure has often been portrayed by poets and writersI would mention the Faust-Mephistopheles relationship and ETAHoffmann's tale The Devil's Elixir as two especially typical descriptionsThe shadow personifies everything that the subject refuses to acknowledge about himself and yet is always thrusting itself upon him directly or indirectly—for instance, inferior traits of character and other incompatible tendencies.
The fact that the unconscious spontaneously personifies certain affectively toned contents in dreams is the reason why I have taken over these personifications in my terminology and formulated them as names.
Besides these figures there are still a few others, less frequent and less striking, which have likewise undergone poetic as well as mythological formulationI would mention, for instance, the figure of the hero and of the wise old man, to name only two of the best known.
All these figures irrupt autonomously into consciousness as soon as it gets into a pathological stateWith regard to the anima, I would particularly like to draw attention to the case described by NelkenNow the remarkable thing is that these figures show the most striking connections with the poetic, religious, or mythological formulations, though these connections are in no way factualThat is to say, they are spontaneous products of analogyOne such case even led to the charge of plagiarism: the French writer Benoît gave a description of the anima and her classic myth in his book L'Atlantide, which is an exact parallel of Rider Haggard's SheThe lawsuit proved unsuccessful; Benoît had never heard of She(It might, in the last analysis, have been an instance of cryptomnesic deception, which is often extremely difficult to rule out.) The distinctly historical aspect of the anima and her condensation with the figures of the sister, wife, mother, and daughter, plus the associated incest motif, can be found in Goethe (You were in times gone by my wife or sister), as well as in the anima figure of the regina or femina alba in alchemyThe English alchemist Eirenaeus Philalethes (lover of truth), writing about , remarks that the Queen was the King's sister, mother, or wife. The same idea can be found, ornately elaborated, in Nelken's patient and in a whole series of cases observed by me, where I was able to rule out with certainty any possibility of literary influenceFor the rest, the anima complex is one of the oldest features of Latin alchemy.
When one studies the archetypal personalities and their behaviour with the help of the dreams, fantasies, and delusions of patients, one is profoundly impressed by their manifold and unmistakable connections with mythological ideas completely unknown to the laymanThey form a species of singular beings whom one would like to endow with ego-consciousness; indeed, they almost seem capable of itAnd yet this idea is not borne out by the factsThere is nothing in their behaviour to suggest that they have an ego-consciousness as we know itThey show, on the contrary, all the marks of fragmentary personalitiesThey are masklike, wraithlike, without problems, lacking self-reflection, with no conflicts, no doubts, no sufferings; like gods, perhaps, who have no philosophy, such as the Brahma-gods of the Samyutta-nikãya, whose erroneous views needed correction by the BuddhaUnlike other contents, they always remain strangers in the world of consciousness, unwelcome intruders saturating the atmosphere with uncanny forebodings or even with the fear of madness.
If we examine their content, i.e., the fantasy material constituting their phenomenology, we find countless archaic and historical associations and images of an archetypal natureThis peculiar fact permits us to draw conclusions about the localization of anima and animus in the psychic structureThey evidently live and function in the deeper layers of the unconscious, especially in that phylogenetic substratum which I have called the collective unconsciousThis localization explains a good deal of their strangeness: they bring into our ephemeral consciousness an unknown psychic life belonging to a remote pastIt is the mind of our unknown ancestors, their way of thinking and feeling, their way of experiencing life and the world, gods and menThe existence of these archaic strata is presumably the source of man's belief in reincarnations and in memories of previous existences. Just as the human body is a museum, so to speak, of its phylogenetic history, so too is the psycheWe have no reason to suppose that the specific structure of the psyche is the only thing in the world that has no history outside its individual manifestationsEven the conscious mind cannot be denied a history reaching back at least five thousand yearsIt is only our ego-consciousness that has forever a new beginning and an early endThe unconscious psyche is not only immensely old, it is also capable of growing into an equally remote futureIt moulds the human species and is just as much a part of it as the human body, which, though ephemeral in the individual, is collectively of immense age.
The anima and animus live in a world quite different from the world outside—in a world where the pulse of time beats infinitely slowly, where the birth and death of individuals count for littleNo wonder their nature is strange, so strange that their irruption into consciousness often amounts to a psychosisThey undoubtedly belong to the material that comes to light in schizophrenia.
What I have said about the collective unconscious may give you a more or less adequate idea of what I mean by this termIf we now turn back to the problem of individuation, we shall see ourselves faced with a rather extraordinary task: the psyche consists of two incongruous halves which together should form a wholeOne is inclined to think that ego-consciousness is capable of assimilating the unconscious, at least one hopes that such a solution is possibleBut unfortunately the unconscious really is unconscious; in other words, it is unknownAnd how can you assimilate something unknown? Even if you can form a fairly complete picture of the anima and animus, this does not mean that you have plumbed the depths of the unconsciousOne hopes to control the unconscious, but the past masters in the art of self-control, the yogis, attain perfection in samadhi, a state of ecstasy, which so far as we know is equivalent to a state of unconsciousnessIt makes no difference whether they call our unconscious a universal consciousness; the fact remains that in their case the unconscious has swallowed up ego-consciousnessThey do not realize that a universal consciousness is a contradiction in terms, since exclusion, selection, and discrimination are the root and essence of everything that lays claim to the name consciousness. Universal consciousness is logically identical with unconsciousnessIt is nevertheless true that a correct application of the methods described in the Pāli Canon or in the Yoga-sütra induces a remarkable extension of consciousnessBut, with increasing extension, the contents of consciousness lose in clarity of detailIn the end, consciousness becomes all-embracing, but nebulous; an infinite number of things merge into an indefinite whole, a state in which subject and object are almost completely identicalThis is all very beautiful, but scarcely to be recommended anywhere north of the Tropic of Cancer.
For this reason we must look for a different solutionWe believe in ego-consciousness and in what we call realityThe realities of a northern climate are somehow so convincing that we feel very much better off when we do not forget themFor us it makes sense to concern ourselves with realityOur European ego-consciousness is therefore inclined to swallow up the unconscious, and if this should not prove feasible we try to suppress itBut if we understand anything of the unconscious, we know that it cannot be swallowedWe also know that it is dangerous to suppress it, because the unconscious is life and this life turns against us if suppressed, as happens in neurosis.
Conscious and unconscious do not make a whole when one of them is suppressed and injured by the otherIf they must contend, let it at least be a fair fight with equal rights on both sidesBoth are aspects of lifeConsciousness should defend its reason and protect itself, and the chaotic life of the unconscious should be given the chance of having its way too—as much of it as we can standThis means open conflict and open collaboration at onceThat, evidently, is the way human life should beIt is the old game of hammer and anvil: between them the patient iron is forged into an indestructible whole, an individual.
This, roughly, is what I mean by the individuation processAs the name shows, it is a process or course of development arising out of the conflict between the two fundamental psychic factsI have described the problems of this conflict, at least in their essentials, in my essay The Relations between the Ego and the Unconscious. A special chapter, however, is the symbolism of the process, which is of the utmost importance for understanding the final stages of the encounter between conscious and unconscious, in practice as well as in theoryMy investigations during these last years have been devoted mainly to this themeIt turned out, to my own great astonishment, that the symbol formation has the closest affinities with alchemical ideas, and especially with the conceptions of the uniting symbol, which yield highly significant parallelsNaturally these are processes which have no meaning in the initial stages of psychological treatmentOn the other hand, more difficult cases, such as cases of unresolved transference, develop these symbolsKnowledge of them is of inestimable importance in treating cases of this kind, especially when dealing with cultured patients.
How the harmonizing of conscious and unconscious data is to be undertaken cannot be indicated in the form of a recipeIt is an irrational life-process which expresses itself in definite symbolsIt may be the task of the analyst to stand by this process with all the help he can giveIn this case, knowledge of the symbols is indispensable, for it is in them that the union of conscious and unconscious contents is consummatedOut of this union emerge new situations and new conscious attitudesI have therefore called the union of opposites the transcendent function. This rounding out of the personality into a whole may well be the goal of any psychotherapy that claims to be more than a mere cure of symptoms.
During the 's, I made the acquaintance in America of a lady with an academic education—we will call her Miss X—who had studied psychology for nine yearsShe had read all the more recent literature in this fieldIn , at the age of fifty-five, she came to Europe in order to continue her studies under my guidanceAs the daughter of an exceptional father she had varied interests, was extremely cultured, and possessed a lively turn of mindShe was unmarried, but lived with the unconscious equivalent of a human partner, namely the animus (the personification of everything masculine in a woman), in that characteristic liaison so often met with in women with an academic educationAs frequently happens, this development of hers was based on a positive father complex: she was fille à papa and consequently did not have a good relation to her motherHer animus was not of the kind to give her cranky ideasShe was protected from this by her natural intelligence and by a remarkable readiness to tolerate the opinions of other peopleThis good quality, by no means to be expected in the presence of an animus, had, in conjunction with some difficult experiences that could not be avoided, enabled her to realize that she had reached a limit and got stuck, and this made it urgently necessary for her to look round for ways that might lead her out of the impasseThat was one of the reasons for her trip to EuropeAssociated with this there was another—not accidental—motiveOn her mother's side she was of Scandinavian descentSince her relation to her mother left very much to be desired, as she herself clearly realized, the feeling had gradually grown up in her that this side of her nature might have developed differently if only the relation to her mother had given it a chanceIn deciding to go to Europe she was conscious that she was turning back to her own origins and was setting out to reactivate a portion of her childhood that was bound up with the motherBefore coming to Zurich she had gone back to Denmark, her mother's countryThere the thing that affected her most was the landscape, and unexpectedly there came over her the desire to paint—above all, landscape motifsTill then she had noticed no such aesthetic inclinations in herself, also she lacked the ability to paint or drawShe tried her hand at water-colours, and her modest landscapes filled her with a strange feeling of contentmentPainting them, she told me, seemed to fill her with new lifeArriving in Zurich, she continued her painting efforts, and on the day before she came to me for the first time she began another landscape—this time from memoryWhile she was working on it, a fantasy-image suddenly thrust itself between her and the picture: she saw herself with the lower half of her body in the earth, stuck fast in a block of rockThe region round about was a beach strewn with bouldersIn the background was the seaShe felt caught and helplessThen she suddenly saw me in the guise of a medieval sorcererShe shouted for help, I came along and touched the rock with a magic wandThe stone instantly burst open, and she stepped out uninjuredShe then painted this fantasy-image instead of the landscape and brought it to me on the following day.
As usually happens with beginners and people with no skill of hand, the drawing of the picture cost her considerable difficultiesIn such cases it is very easy for the unconscious to slip its subliminal images into the paintingThus it came about that the big boulders would not appear on the paper in their real form but took on unexpected shapesThey looked, some of them, like hardboiled eggs cut in two, with the yolk in the middleOthers were like pointed pyramidsIt was in one of these that Miss X was stuckHer hair, blown out behind her, and the movement of the sea suggested a strong wind.
The picture shows first of all her imprisoned state, but not yet the act of liberationSo it was there that she was attached to the earth, in the land of her motherPsychologically this state means being caught in the unconsciousHer inadequate relation to her mother had left behind something dark and in need of developmentSince she succumbed to the magic of her motherland and tried to express this by painting, it is obvious that she is still stuck with half her body in Mother Earth: that is, she is still partly identical with the mother and, what is more, through that part of the body which contains just that secret of the mother which she had never inquired into.
Since Miss X had discovered all by herself the method of active imagination I have long been accustomed to use, I was able to approach the problem at just the point indicated by the picture: she is caught in the unconscious and expects magical help from me, as from a sorcererAnd since her psychological knowledge had made her completely au fait with certain possible interpretations, there was no need of even an understanding wink to bring to light the apparent sous-entendu of the liberating magician's wandThe sexual symbolism, which for many naïve minds is of such capital importance, was no discovery for herShe was far enough advanced to know that explanations of this kind, however true they might be in other respects, had no significance in her caseShe did not want to know how liberation might be possible in a general way, but how and in what way it could come about for herAnd about this I knew as little as sheI know that such solutions can only come about in an individual way that cannot be foreseenOne cannot think up ways and means artificially, let alone know them in advance, for such knowledge is merely collective, based on average experience, and can therefore be completely inadequate, indeed absolutely wrong, in individual casesAnd when, on top of that, we consider the patient's age, we would do well to abandon from the start any attempt to apply ready-made solutions and warmed-up generalities of which the patient knows just as much as the doctorLong experience has taught me not to know anything in advance and not to know better, but to let the unconscious take precedenceOur instincts have ridden so infinitely many times, unharmed, over the problems that arise at this stage of life that we may be sure the transformation processes which make the transition possible have long been prepared in the unconscious and are only waiting to be released.
I had already seen from her previous history how the unconscious made use of the patient's inability to draw in order to insinuate its own suggestionsI had not overlooked the fact that the boulders had surreptitiously transformed themselves into eggsThe egg is a germ of life with a lofty symbolical significanceIt is not just a cosmogonic symbol—it is also a philosophical oneAs the former it is the Orphic egg, the world's beginning; as the latter, the philosophical egg of the medieval natural philosophers, the vessel from which, at the end of the opus alchymicum, the homunculus emerges, that is, the Anthropos, the spiritual, inner and complete man, who in Chinese alchemy is called the chen-yen (literally, perfect man).
From this hint, therefore, I could already see what solution the unconscious had in mind, namely individuation, for this is the transformation process that loosens the attachment to the unconsciousIt is a definitive solution, for which all other ways serve as auxiliaries and temporary makeshiftsThis knowledge, which for the time being I kept to myself, bade me act with cautionI therefore advised Miss X not to let it go at a mere fantasy-image of the act of liberation, but to try to make a picture of itHow this would turn out I could not guess, and that was a good thing, because otherwise I might have put Miss X on the wrong track from sheer helpfulnessShe found this task terribly difficult owing to her artistic inhibitionsSo I counselled her to content herself with what was possible and to use her fantasy for the purpose of circumventing technical difficultiesThe object of this advice was to introduce as much fantasy as possible into the picture, for in that way the unconscious has the best chance of revealing its contentsI also advised her not to be afraid of bright colours, for I knew from experience that vivid colours seem to attract the unconsciousThereupon, a new picture arose.
Again there are boulders, the round and pointed forms; but the round ones are no longer eggs, they are complete circles, and the pointed ones are tipped with golden lightOne of the round forms has been blasted out of its place by a golden flash of lightningThe magician and magic wand are no longer thereThe personal relationship to me seems to have ceased: the picture shows an impersonal natural process.
While Miss X was painting this picture she made all sorts of discoveriesAbove all, she had no notion of what picture she was going to paintShe tried to reimagine the initial situation; the rocky shore and the sea are proof of thisBut the eggs turned into abstract spheres or circles, and the magician's touch became a flash of lightning cutting through her unconscious stateWith this transformation she had rediscovered the historical synonym of the philosophical egg, namely the rotundum, the round, original form of the Anthropos (or στοιχάεῖον στρογγυ'λον, round element,' as Zosimos calls it)This is an idea that has been associated with the Anthropos since ancient timesThe soul, too, according to tradition, has a round formAs the Monk of Heisterbach says, it is not only like to the sphere of the moon, but is furnished on all sides with eyes (ex omni parte oculata)We shall come back to this motif of polyophthalmia later onHis remark refers in all probability to certain parapsychological phenomena, the globes of light or globular luminosities which, with remarkable consistency, are regarded as souls in the remotest parts of the world.
The liberating flash of lightning is a symbol also used by Paracelsus and the alchemists for the same thingMoses' rock-splitting staff, which struck forth the living water and afterwards changed into a serpent, may have been an unconscious echo in the backgroundLightning signifies a sudden, unexpected, and overpowering change of psychic condition.
In this Spirit of the Fire-flash consists the Great Almighty Life, says Jakob BöhmeFor when you strike upon the sharp part of the stone, the bitter sting of Nature sharpens itself, and is stirred in the highest degreeFor Nature is dissipated or broken asunder in the sharpness, so that the Liberty shines forth as a Flash. The flash is the Birth of the light. It has transformative power: For if I could in my Flesh comprehend the Flash, which I very well see and know how it is, I could clarify or trans figure my Body therewith, so that it would shine with a bright light and gloryAnd then it would no more resemble and be conformed to the bestial Body, but to the angels of God. Elsewhere Böhme says: As when the Flash of Life rises up in the centre of the Divine Power, wherein all the spirits of God attain their life, and highly rejoice. Of the Source-spirit Mercurius, he says that it arises in the Fire-flash. Mercurius is the animal spirit which, from Lucifer's body, struck into the Salniter of God like a fiery serpent from its hole, as if there went a fiery Thunder-bolt into God's Nature, or a fierce Serpent, which tyrannizes, raves, and rages, as if it would tear and rend Nature all to pieces. Of the innermost birth of the soul the bestial body attains only a glimpse, just as if it lightened. The triumphing divine Birth lasteth in us men only so long as the flash lasteth; therefore our knowledge is but in part, whereas in God the flash stands unchangeably, always eternally thus. (CfFig.)
In this connection I would like to mention that Böhme associates lightning with something else tooThat is the quaternity, which plays a great role in the following picturesWhen caught and assuaged in the four Qualities or four Spirits, the Flash, or the Light, subsists in the Midst or Centre as a HeartNow when that Light, which stands in the Midst or Centre, shines into the four Spirits, then the Power of the four Spirits rises up in the Light, and they become Living, and love the Light; that is, they take it into them, and are impregnated with it. The Flash, or Stock, or Pith, or the Heart, which is generated in the Powers, remains standing in the Midst or Centre, and that is the Son… And this is the true Holy Ghost, whom we Christians honour and adore for the third Person in the Deity. Elsewhere Böhme says: When the Fire-flash reaches the dark substance, it is a great terror, from which the Cold Fire draws back in affright as if it would perish, and becomes impotent, and sinks into itself, … But now the Flash … makes in its Rising a Cross with the Comprehension of all Properties; for here arises the Spirit in the Essence, and it stands thus: If thou hast here understanding, thou needest ask no more; it is Eternity and Time, God in Love and Anger, also Heaven and HellThe lower part, which is thus marked, is the first Principle, and is the Eternal Nature in the Anger, vizthe Kingdom of Darkness dwelling in itself; and the upper Part, with this figure , is the Salniter; the Upper Cross above the Circle is the Kingdom of Glory, which in the Flagrat of Joy in the Will of the free Lubet proceeds from the Fire in the Lustre of the Light into the power of the Liberty; and this spiritual Water … is the Corporality of the free Lubet … wherein the Lustre from the Fire and Light makes a Tincture, viza budding and growing and a Manifestation of Colours from the Fire and Light.
I have purposely dwelt at some length on Böhme's disquisition on the lightning, because it throws a good deal of light on the psychology of our picturesHowever, it anticipates some things that will only become clear when we examine the pictures themselvesI must therefore ask the reader to bear Böhme's views in mind in the following commentaryI have put the most important points in italicsIt is clear from the quotations what the lightning meant to Böhme and what sort of a role it plays in the present caseThe last quotation in particular deserves special attention, as it anticipates various key motifs in the subsequent pictures done by my patient, namely the cross, the quaternity, the divided mandala, the lower half of which is virtually equivalent to hell and the upper half to the lighter realm of the Salniter. For Böhme the lower half signifies the everlasting darkness that extends into the fire, while the upper, salnitrous half corresponds to the third Principle, the visible, elemental world, which is an emanation of the first and other Principle. The cross, in turn, corresponds to the second Principle, the Kingdom of Glory, which is revealed through magic fire, the lightning, which he calls a Revelation of Divine Motion. The lustre of the fire comes from the unity of God and reveals his willThe mandala therefore represents the Kingdom of Nature, which in itself is the great everlasting Darkness. The Kingdom of God, on the other hand, or the Glory (i.e., the Cross), is the Light of which John  :  speaks: And the light shineth in the darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not. The Life that breaks itself off from the eternal Light and enters into the Object, as into the selfhood of Properties, is only fantastic and foolish, even such as the Devils were, and the souls of the damned are; as can be seen … from the fourth number. For the fire of Nature is called by Böhme the fourth form, and he understands it as a spiritual Life-Fire, that exists from a continual conjunction … of Hardness i.e., the solidified, dry Salniter and Motion the Divine Will. Quite in keeping with John  :  the quaternity of the lightning, the Cross, pertains to the Kingdom of Glory, whereas Nature, the visible world and the dark abyss remain untouched by the fourfold light and abide in darkness.
For the sake of completeness I should mention that is the sign for cinnabar, the most important quicksilver ore (HgS)The coincidence of the two symbols can hardly be accidental in view of the significance which Böhme attributes to MercuriusRuland finds it rather hard to define exactly what was meant by cinnabarThe only certain thing is that there was a κιννάβαρις τών ϕιλοσόϕων (cinnabar of the philosophers) in Greek alchemy, and that it stood for the rubedo stage of the transforming substanceThus Zosimos says: (After the preceding process) you will find the gold coloured fiery red like bloodThat is the cinnabar of the philosophers and the copper man (χαλκάνθρωπος, turned to gold. Cinnabar was also supposed to be identical with the uroboros dragonEven in Pliny, cinnabar is called sanguis draconis, dragon's blood,' a term that lasted all through the Middle AgesOn account of its redness it was often identified with the philosophical sulphurA special difficulty is the fact that the wine-red cinnabar crystals were classed with the άνθρακες, carbons, to which belong all reddish and red-tinted stones like rubies, garnets, amethysts, etcThey all shine like glowing coalsThe λιθάνθρακες (anthracites), on the other hand, were regarded as quenched coalsThese associations explain the similarity of the alchemical signs for gold, antimony, and garnetGold , after mercury the most important philosophical substance, shares its sign with what is known as regulus or button antimony, and during the two decades prior to the writing of Signatura return (), from which our quotation comes, this had enjoyed particular fame as the new transformative substance and panaceaBasilius Valentinus' Triumphal Car of Antimony was published about the first decade of the seventeenth century (the first edition possibly in ) and soon found the widest acclaimThe sign for garnet is , and means saltA cross with a little circle in it means copper (from the Cyprian, Venus )Medicinal tartaric acid is denoted by , and hydrogen potassium tartrate (tartar) has the signs Tartar settles on the bottom of the vessel, which in the language of the alchemists means: in the underworld, Tartarus.
I will not attempt here any interpretation of Böhme's symbols, but will only point out that in our picture the lightning, striking into the darkness and hardness, has blasted a rotundum out of the dark massa confusa and kindled a light in itThere can be no doubt that the dark stone means the blackness, i.e., the unconscious, just as the sea and sky and the upper half of the woman's figure indicate the sphere of consciousnessWe may safely assume that Böhme's symbol refers to a similar situationThe lightning has released the spherical form from the rock and so caused a kind of liberationBut, just as the magician has been replaced by the lightning, so the patient has been replaced by the sphereThe unconscious has thus presented her with ideas which show that she had gone on thinking without the aid of consciousness and that this radically altered the initial situationIt was again her inability to draw that led to this resultBefore finding this solution, she had made two attempts to portray the act of liberation with human figures, but with no successShe had overlooked the fact that the initial situation, her imprisonment in the rock, was already irrational and symbolic and therefore could not be solved in a rational wayIt had to be done by an equally irrational processThat was why I advised her, should she fail in her attempt to draw human figures, to use some kind of hieroglyphIt then suddenly struck her that the sphere was a suitable symbol for the individual human beingThat it was a chance idea (Einfall) is proved by the fact that it was not her conscious mind that thought up this typification, but the unconscious, for an Einfall falls in quite of its own accordIt should be noted that she represents only herself as a sphere, not meI am represented only by the lightning, purely functionally, so that for her I am simply the precipitating causeAs a magician I appeared to her in the apt role of Hermes Kyllenios, of whom the Odyssey says: Meanwhile Cyllenian Hermes was gathering in the souls of the suitors, armed with the splendid golden wand that he can use at will to cast a spell on our eyes or wake us from the soundest sleep. Hermes is the ψνχῶν αῖτιος, originator of souls.' He is also the ήγήτωρ ονείρων, guide of dreams. For the following pictures it is of special importance that Hermes has the number  attributed to himMartianus Capella says: The number four is assigned to the Cyllenian, for he alone is held to be a fourfold god.
The form the picture had taken was not unreservedly welcome to the patient's conscious mindLuckily, however, while painting it Miss X had discovered that two factors were involvedThese, in her own words, were reason and the eyesReason always wanted to make the picture as it thought it ought to be; but the eyes held fast to their vision and finally forced the picture to come out as it actually did and not in accordance with rationalistic expectationsHer reason, she said, had really intended a daylight scene, with the sunshine melting the sphere free, but the eyes favoured a nocturne with shattering, dangerous lightning. This realization helped her to acknowledge the actual result of her artistic efforts and to admit that it was in fact an objective and impersonal process and not a personal relationship.
For anyone with a personalistic view of psychic events, such as a Freudian, it will not be easy to see in this anything more than an elaborate repressionBut if there was any repression here we certainly cannot make, the conscious mind responsible for it, because the conscious mind would undoubtedly have preferred a personal imbroglio as being far more interestingThe repression must have been manoeuvred by the unconscious from the startOne should consider what this means: instinct, the most original force of the unconscious, is suppressed or turned back on itself by an arrangement stemming from this same unconscious! It would be idle indeed to talk of repression here, since we know that the unconscious goes straight for its goal and that this does not consist solely in pairing two animals but in allowing an individual to become wholeFor this purpose wholeness—represented by the sphere—is emphasized as the essence of personality, while I am reduced to the fraction of a second, the duration of a lightning flash.
The patient's association to lightning was that it might stand for intuition, a conjecture that is not far off the mark, since intuitions often come like a flash. Moreover, there are good grounds for thinking that Miss X was a sensation typeShe herself thought she was oneThe inferior function would then be intuitionAs such, it would have the significance of a releasing or redeeming functionWe know from experience that the inferior function always compensates, complements, and balances the superior functionMy psychic peculiarity would make me a suitable projection carrier in this respectThe inferior function is the one of which least conscious use is madeThis is the reason for its undifferentiated quality, but also for its freshness and vitalityIt is not at the disposal of the conscious mind, and even after long use it never loses its autonomy and spontaneity, or only to a very limited degreeIts role is therefore mostly that of a deus ex machinaIt depends not on the ego but on the selfHence it hits consciousness unexpectedly, like lightning, and occasionally with devastating consequencesIt thrusts the ego aside and makes room for a supraordinate factor, the totality of a person, which consists of conscious and unconscious and consequently extends far beyond the egoThis self was always present, but sleeping, like Nietzsche's image in the stone. It is, in fact, the secret of the stone, of the lapis philosophorum, in so far as this is the prima materiaIn the stone sleeps the spirit Mercurius, the circle of the moon, the round and square, the homunculus, Tom Thumb and Anthropos at once, whom the alchemists also symbolized as their famed lapis philosophorum.
All these ideas and inferences were naturally unknown to my patient, and they were known to me at the time only in so far as I was able to recognize the circle as a mardala, the psychological expression of the totality of the selfUnder these circumstances there could be no question of my having unintentionally infected her with alchemical ideasThe pictures are, in all essentials, genuine creations of the unconscious; their inessential aspects (landscape motifs) are derived from conscious contents.
Although the sphere with its glowing red centre and the golden flash of lightning play the chief part, it should not be overlooked that there are several other eggs or spheres as wellIf the sphere signifies the self of the patient, we must apply this interpretation to the other spheres, tooThey must therefore represent other people who, in all probability, were her intimatesIn both the pictures two other spheres are clearly indicatedSo I must mention that Miss X had two women friends who shared her intellectual interests and were joined to her in a lifelong friendshipAll three of them, as if bound together by fate, are rooted in the same earth, i.e., in the collective unconscious, which is one and the same for allIt is probably for this reason that the second picture has the decidedly nocturnal character intended by the unconscious and asserted against the wishes of the conscious mindIt should also be mentioned that the pointed pyramids of the first picture reappear in the second, where their points are actually gilded by the lightning and strongly emphasizedI would interpret them as unconscious contents pushing up into the light of consciousness, as seems to be the case with many contents of the collective unconscious.In contrast to the first picture, the second is painted in more vivid colours, red and goldGold expresses sunlight, value, divinity evenIt is therefore a favourite synonym for the lapis, being the aurum philosophicum or aurum potabile or aurum vitreum.
As already pointed out, I was not at that time in a position to reveal anything of these ideas to Miss X, for the simple reason that I myself knew nothing of themI feel compelled to mention this circumstance yet again, because the third picture, which now follows, brings a motif that points unmistakably to alchemy and actually gave me the definitive incentive to make a thorough study of the works of the old adepts.
The third picture, done as spontaneously as the first two, is distinguished most of all by its light coloursFree-floating in space, among clouds, is a dark blue sphere with a wine-red borderRound the middle runs a wavy silver band, which keeps the sphere balanced by equal and opposite forces, as the patient explainedTo the right, above the sphere, floats a snake with golden rings, its head pointing at the sphere—an obvious development of the golden lightning in Picture But she drew the snake in afterwards, on account of certain reflections. The whole is a planet in the making. In the middle of the silver band is the number The band was thought of as being in rapid vibratory motion; hence the wave motifIt is like a vibrating belt that keeps the sphere afloatMiss X compared it to the ring of SaturnBut unlike this, which is composed of disintegrated satellites, her ring was the origin of future moons such as Jupiter possessesThe black lines in the silver band she called lines of force; they were meant to indicate that it was in motionAs if asking a question, I made the remark: Then it is the vibrations of the band that keep the sphere floating? Naturally, she said, they are the wings of Mercury, the messenger of the godsThe silver is quicksilver! She went on at once: Mercury, that is Hermes, is the Nous, the mind or reason, and that is the animus, who is here outside instead of insideHe is like a veil that hides the true personality. We shall leave this latter remark alone for the moment and turn first to the wider context, which, unlike that of the two previous pictures, is especially rich.
While Miss X was painting this picture, she felt that two earlier dreams were mingling with her visionThey were the two big dreams of her lifeShe knew of the attribute big from my stories of the dream life of African primitives I had visitedIt has become a kind of colloquial term for characterizing archetypal dreams, which as we know have a peculiar numinosityIt was used in this sense by the dreamerSeveral years previously, she had undergone a major operationUnder narcosis she had the following dream-vision: She saw a grey globe of the worldA silver band rotated about the equator and, according to the frequency of its vibrations, formed alternate zones of condensation and evaporationIn the zones of condensation appeared the numbers  to , but they had the tendency to increase up to These numbers signified nodal points or great personalities who played a part in man's historical developmentThe number  meant the most important nodal point or great man (still to come), because it denotes the climax or turning point of the process of development. (These are her own words.)
The other dream that intervened had occurred a year before the first one: She saw a golden snake in the skyIt demanded the sacrifice, from among a great crowd of people, of a young man, who obeyed this demand with an expression of sorrowThe dream was repeated a little later, but this time the snake picked on the dreamer herselfThe assembled people regarded her compassionately, but she took her fate proudly on herself.
She was, as she told me, born immediately after midnight, so soon afterwards, indeed, that there was some doubt as to whether she came into the world on the th or on the thHer father used to tease her by saying that she was obviously born before her time, since she came into the world just at the beginning of a new day, but only just, so that one could almost believe she was born at the twelfth hour. The number , as she said, meant for her the culminating point of her life, which she had only now reachedThat is, she felt the liberation as the climax of her lifeIt is indeed an hour of birth—not of the dreamer but of the selfThis distinction must be borne in mind.
The context to Picture  here established needs a little commentaryFirst, it must be emphasized that the patient felt the moment of painting this picture as the climax of her life and also described it as suchSecond, two big dreams have amalgamated in the picture, which heightens its significance still moreThe sphere blasted from the rock in Picture  has now, in the brighter atmosphere, floated up to heavenThe nocturnal darkness of the earth has vanishedThe increase of light indicates conscious realization: the liberation has become a fact that is integrated into consciousnessThe patient has understood that the floating sphere symbolizes the true personality. At present, however, it is not quite clear how she understands the relation of the ego to the true personality. The term chosen by her coincides in a remarkable way with the Chinese chen-yen, the true or complete man, who has the closest affinity with the homo quadratus of alchemyAs we pointed out in the analysis of Picture , the rotundum of alchemy is identical with Mercurius, the round and square. In Picture  the connection is shown concretely through the mediating idea of the wings of Mercury, who, it is evident, has entered the picture in his own right and not because of any non-existent knowledge of Böhme's writings.
For the alchemists the process of individuation represented by the opus was an analogy of the creation of the world, and the opus itself an analogy of God's work of creationMan was seen as a microcosm, a complete equivalent of the world in miniatureIn our picture, we see what it is in man that corresponds to the cosmos, and what kind of evolutionary process is compared with the creation of the world and the heavenly bodies: it is the birth of the self, the latter appearing as a microcosmIt is not the empirical man that forms the correspondentia to the world, as the medievalists thought, but rather the indescribable totality of the psychic or spiritual man, who cannot be described because he is compounded of consciousness as well as of the indeterminable extent of the unconsciousThe term microcosm proves the existence of a common intuition (also present in my patient) that the total man is as big as the world, like an AnthroposThe cosmic analogy had already appeared in the much earlier dream under narcosis, which likewise contained the problem of personality: the nodes of the vibrations were great personalities of historical importanceAs early as , I had observed a similar individuation process, illustrated by pictures, in another woman patientIn her case too there was a world creation, depicted as follows (see Fig):
To the left, from an unknown source, three drops fall, dissolving into four lines, or two pairs of linesThese lines move and form four separate paths, which then unite periodically in a nodal point and thus build a system of vibrationsThe nodes are great personalities and founders of religions, as my erstwhile patient told meIt is obviously the same conception as in our case, and we can call it archetypal in so far as there exist universal ideas of world periods, critical transitions, gods and half gods who personify the aeonsThe unconscious naturally does not produce its images from conscious reflections, but from the worldwide propensity of the human system to form such conceptions as the world periods of the Parsees, the yugas and avatars of Hinduism, and the Platonic months of astrology with their bull and ram deities and the great Fish of the Christian aeon.
That the nodes in our patient's picture signify or contain numbers is a bit of unconscious number mysticism that is not always easy to unravelSo far as I can see, there are two stages in this arithmetical phenomenology: the first, earlier stage goes up to , the second, later stage up to Two numbers,  and , are expressly mentionedTwelve is four times threeI think we have here stumbled again on the axiom of Maria, that peculiar dilemma of three and four, which I have discussed many times before because it plays such a great role in alchemyI would hazard that we have to do here with a tetrameria (as in Greek alchemy), a transformation process divided into four stages of three parts each, analogous to the twelve transformations of the zodiac and its division into fourAs not infrequently happens, the number  would then have a not merely individual significance (as the patient's birth number, for instance), but a time-conditioned one too, since the present aeon of the Fishes is drawing to its end and is at the same time the twelfth house of the zodiacOne is reminded of similar Gnostic ideas, such as those in the gnosis of Justin: The Father (Elohim) begets with Edem, who was half woman and half snake, twelve fatherly angels, and Edem gives birth besides these to twelve motherly angels, who—in psychological parlance—represent the shadows of the twelve fatherly onesThe motherly angels divide themselves into four categories (μέρη) of three each, corresponding to the four rivers of ParadiseThese angels dance round in a circle (ὲν χόρῳ κνκλικῷ).It is legitimate to bring these seemingly remote associations into hypothetical relationship, because they all spring from a common root, i.e., the collective unconscious.
In our picture Mercurius forms a world-encircling band, usually represented by a snakeMercurius is a serpent or dragon in alchemy (serpens mercurialis)Oddly enough, this serpent is some distance away from the sphere and is aiming down at it, as if to strikeThe sphere, we are told, is kept afloat by equal and opposite forces, represented by the quicksilver or somehow connected with itAccording to the old view, Mercurius is duplex, i.e., he is himself an antithesisMercurius or Hermes is a magician and god of magiciansAs Hermes Trismegistus he is the patriarch of alchemyHis magician's wand, the caduceus, is entwined by two snakesThe same attribute distinguishes Asklepios, the god of physiciansThe archetype of these ideas was projected on to me by the patient before ever the analysis had begun.
The primordial image underlying the sphere girdled with quicksilver is probably that of the world egg encoiled by a snakeBut in our case the snake symbol of Mercurius is replaced by a sort of pseudo-physicistic notion of a field of vibrating molecules of quicksilverThis looks like an intellectual disguising of the true situation, that the self, or its symbol, is entwined by the mercurial serpentAs the patient remarked more or less correctly, the true personality is veiled by itThis, presumably, would then be something like an Eve in the coils of the paradisal serpentIn order to avoid giving this appearance, Mercurius has obligingly split into his two forms, according to the old-established pattern: the mercurius crudus or vulgi (crude or ordinary quicksilver), and the Mercurius Philosophorum (the spiritus mercurialis or the spirit Mercurius, Hermes-Nous), who hovers in the sky as the golden lightning-snake or Nous Serpent, at present inactiveIn the vibrations of the quicksilver band we may discern a certain tremulous excitement, just as the suspension expresses tense expectation: Hover and haver suspended in pain! For the alchemists quicksilver meant the concrete, material manifestation of the spirit Mercurius, as the above-mentioned mandala in the scholia to the Tractatus aureus shows: the central point is Mercurius, and the square is Mercurius divided into the four elementsHe is the anima mundi, the innermost point and at the same time the encompasser of the world, like the atman in the UpanishadsAnd just as quicksilver is a materialization of Mercurius, so the gold is a materialization of the sun in the earth.
A circumstance that never ceases to astonish one is this: that at all times and in all places alchemy brought its conception of the lapis or its minera (raw material) together with the idea of the homo altus or maximus, that is, with the AnthroposEqually, one must stand amazed at the fact that here too the conception of the dark round stone blasted out of the rock should represent such an abstract idea as the psychic totality of manThe earth and in particular the heavy cold stone is the epitome of materiality, and so is the metallic quicksilver which, the patient thought, meant the animus (mind, nous)We would expect pneumatic symbols for the idea of the self and the animus, images of air, breath, windThe ancient formula λίθος où λίθος (the stone that is no stone) expresses this dilemma: we are dealing with a complexio oppositorum, with something like the nature of light, which under some conditions behaves like particles and under others like waves, and is obviously in its essence both at onceSomething of this kind must be conjectured with regard to these paradoxical and hardly explicable statements of the unconsciousThey are not inventions of any conscious mind, but are spontaneous manifestations of a psyche not controlled by consciousness and obviously possessing all the freedom it wants to express views that take no account of our conscious intentionsThe duplicity of Mercurius, his simultaneously metallic and pneumatic nature, is a parallel to the symbolization of an extremely spiritual idea like the Anthropos by a corporeal, indeed metallic, substance (gold)One can only conclude that the unconscious tends to regard spirit and matter not merely as equivalent but as actually identical, and this in flagrant contrast to the intellectual one-sidedness of consciousness, which would sometimes like to spiritualize matter and at other times to materialize spiritThat the lapis, or in our case the floating sphere, has a double meaning is clear from the circumstance that it is characterized by two symbolical colours: red means blood and affectivity, the physiological reaction that joins spirit to body, and blue means the spiritual process (mind or nous)This duality reminds one of the alchemical duality corpus and spiritus, joined together by a third, the anima as the ligamentum corporis et spiritusFor Böhme a high deep blue mixed with green signifies Liberty, that is, the inner Kingdom of Glory of the reborn soulRed leads to the region of fire and the abyss of darkness, which forms the periphery of Böhme's mandala (see Fig).
Picture , which now follows, shows a significant change: the sphere has divided into an outer membrane and an inner nucleusThe outer membrane is flesh coloured, and the originally rather nebulous red nucleus in Picture  now has a differentiated internal structure of a decidedly ternary characterThe lines of force that originally belonged to the band of quicksilver now run through the whole nuclear body, indicating that the excitation is no longer external only but has seized the innermost coreAn enormous inner activity now began, the patient told meThe nucleus with its ternary structure is presumably the female organ, stylized to look like a plant, in the act of fecundation: the spermatozoon is penetrating the nuclear membraneIts role is played by the mercurial serpent: the snake is black, dark, chthonic, a subterranean and ithyphallic Hermes; but it has the golden wings of Mercury and consequently possesses his pneumatic natureThe alchemists accordingly represented their Mercurius duplex as the winged and wingless dragon, calling the former feminine and the latter masculine.
The serpent in our picture represents not so much the spermatozoon but, more accurately, the phallusLeone Ebreo, in his Dialoghi d'amore, calls the planet Mercury the membrum virile of heaven, that is, of the macrocosm conceived as the homo maximusThe spermatozoon seems, rather, to correspond to the golden substance which the snake is injecting into the invaginated ectoderm of the nucleusThe two silver petals (?) probably represent the receptive vessel, the moon-bowl in which the sun's seed (gold) is destined to restUnderneath the flower is a small violet circle inside the ovary, indicating by its colour that it is a united double nature, spirit and body (blue and red)The snake has a pale yellow halo, which is meant to express its numinosity.
Since the snake evolved out of the flash of lightning or is a modulated form of it, I would like to instance a parallel where the lightning has the same illuminating, vivifying, fertilizing, transforming and healing function that in our case falls to the snake (cfFig)Two phases are represented: first, a black sphere, signifying a state of profound depression; and second, the lightning that strikes into this sphereOrdinary speech makes use of the same imagery: something strikes home in a flash of revelation. The only difference is that generally the image comes first, and only afterwards the realization which enables the patient to say: This has struck home.
In an earlier picture the sphere lay on the bottom of the seaAs a series of pictures shows, it arose in the first place because a black snake had swallowed the sunThere then followed an eight-rayed, completely black mandala with a wreath of eight silver starsIn the centre was a black homunculusNext the black sphere developed a red centre, from which red rays, or streams of blood, ran out into tentacle-like extremitiesThe whole thing looked rather like a crab or an octopusAs the later pictures showed, the patient herself was shut up in the sphere.
As to the context of Picture , Miss X emphasized that what disturbed her most was the band of quicksilver in Picture She felt the silvery substance ought to be inside, the black lines of force remaining outside to form a black snakeThis would now encircle the sphereShe felt the snake at first as a terrible danger, as something threatening the integrity of the sphere. At the point where the snake penetrates the nuclear membrane, fire breaks out (emotion)Her conscious mind interpreted this conflagration as a defensive reaction on the part of the sphere, and accordingly she tried to depict the attack as having been repulsedBut this attempt failed to satisfy the eyes, though she showed me a pencil sketch of itShe was obviously in a dilemma: she could not accept the snake, because its sexual significance was only too clear to her without any assistance from meI merely remarked to her: This is a well-known process which you can safely accept, and showed her from my collection a similar picture, done by a man, of a floating sphere being penetrated from below by a black phallus-like objectLater she said: I suddenly understood the whole process in a more impersonal way. It was the realization of a law of life to which sex is subordinatedThe ego was not the centre, but, following a universal law, I circled round a sun. Thereupon she was able to accept the snake as a necessary part of the process of growth and finish the picture quickly and satisfactorilyOnly one thing continued to give difficulty: she had to put the snake, she said, One hundred per cent at the top, in the middle, in order to satisfy the eyes. Evidently the unconscious would only be satisfied with the most important position at the top and in the middle—in direct contrast to the picture I had previously shown herThis, as I said, was done by a man and showed the menacing black symbol entering the mandala from belowFor a woman, the typical danger emanating from the unconscious comes from above, from the spiritual sphere personified by the animus, whereas for a man it comes from the chthonic realm of the world and woman, i.e., the anima projected on to the world.
Once again we must recall similar ideas found in Justin's gnosis: the third of the fatherly angels is BaruchHe is also the tree of life in paradiseHis counterpart on the motherly side is Naas, the serpent, who is the tree of knowledge of good and evilWhen Elohim left Edem, because, as the second member, he had retreated to the first member of the divine triad (which consisted of the Good, the Father, and Edem), Edem pursued the pneuma of the Father, which he had left behind in man, and caused it to be tormented by Naas (ῖνα πάσαις κολάσεικολάζη τó ὂν πνευμα του 'Eλωεὶμ τò ἐν τοϊς άνθρωποις), Naas defiled Eve and also used Adam as a catamiteEdem, however, is the soul; Elohim is spiritThe soul is against the spirit, and the spirit against the soul (κατà τής ψυχής τετάκται)This idea sheds light on the polarity of red and blue in our mandala, and also on the attack by the snake, who represents knowledgeThat is why we fear knowledge of the truth, in this case, of the shadowTherefore Baruch sent to mankind Jesus, that they might be led back to the Good. But the Good One is Priapus. Elohim is the swan, Edem is Leda; he the gold, she DanaeNor should we forget that the god of revelation has from of old the form of a snake—e.g., the agathodaimonEdem too, as a snake-maiden, has a dual nature, two-minded, two-bodied (δίγνωμος, δίσωμος), and in medieval alchemy her figure became the symbol of the androgynous Mercurius.
Let us remember that in Picture  Mercurius vulgi, ordinary quicksilver, encircles the sphereThis means that the mysterious sphere is enveloped or veiled by a vulgar or crude understandingThe patient herself opined that the animus veils the true personality. We shall hardly be wrong in assuming that a banal, everyday view of the world, allegedly biological, has here got hold of the sexual symbol and concretized it after the approved patternA pardonable error! Another, more correct view is so much more subtle that one naturally prefers to fall back on something well-known and ready to hand, thus gratifying one's own rational expectations and earning the applause of one's contemporaries—only to discover that one has got hopelessly stuck and has arrived back at the point from which one set forth on the great adventureIt is clear what is meant by the ithyphallic serpent: from above comes all that is aerial, intellectual, spiritual, and from below all that is passionate, corporeal, and darkThe snake, contrary to expectation, turns out to be a pneumatic symbol, a Mercurius spiritualis—a realization which the patient herself formulated by saying that the ego, despite its capricious manipulation of sexuality, is subject to a universal lawSex in this case is therefore no problem at all, as it has been subjected to a higher transformation process and is contained in it; not repressed, only without an object.
Miss X subsequently told me that she felt Picture  was the most difficult, as if it denoted the turning point of the whole processIn my view she may not have been wrong in this, because the clearly felt, ruthless setting aside of the so beloved and so important ego is no light matterNot for nothing is this letting go the sine qua non of all forms of higher spiritual development, whether we call it meditation, contemplation, yoga, or spiritual exercisesBut, as this case shows, relinquishing the ego is not an act of the will and not a result arbitrarily produced; it is an event, an occurrence, whose inner, compelling logic can be disguised only by wilful self-deception.
In this case and at this moment the ability to let go is of decisive importanceBut since everything passes, the moment may come when the relinquished ego must be reinstated in its functionsLetting go gives the unconscious the opportunity it has been waiting forBut since it consists of opposites—day and night, bright and dark, positive and negative—and is good and evil and therefore ambivalent, the moment will infallibly come when the individual, like the exemplary Job, must hold fast so as not to be thrown catastrophically off balance—when the wave reboundsThe holding fast can be achieved only by a conscious will, i.e., by the egoThat is the great and irreplaceable significance of the ego, but one which, as we see here, is nonetheless relativeRelative, too, is the gain won by integrating the unconsciousWe add to ourselves a bright and a dark, and more light means more nightThe urge of consciousness towards wider horizons, however, cannot be stopped; they must needs extend the scope of the personality, if they are not to shatter it.
Picture , Miss X said, followed naturally from Picture , with no difficultyThe sphere and the snake have drawn apartThe snake is sinking downwards and seems to have lost its threateningnessBut the sphere has been fecundated with a vengeance: it has not only got bigger, but blossoms in the most vivid coloursThe nucleus has divided into four; something like a segmentation has occurredThis is not due to any conscious reflection, such as might come naturally to a biologically educated person; the division of the process or of the central symbol into four has always existed, beginning with the four sons of Horus, or the four seraphim of Ezekiel, or the birth of the four Aeons from the Metra (uterus) impregnated by the pneuma in Barbelo-Gnosis, or the cross formed by the lightning (snake) in Böhme's system, and ending with the tetrameria of the opus alchymicum and its components (the four elements, qualities, stages, etc.)In each case the quaternity forms a unity; here it is the green circle at the centre of the fourThe four are undifferentiated, and each of them forms a vortex, apparently turning to the leftI think I am not mistaken in regarding it as probable that, in general, a leftward movement indicates movement towards the unconscious, while a rightward (clockwise) movement goes towards consciousnessThe one is sinister, the other right, rightful, correct. In Tibet, the leftward-moving swastika is a sign of the Bön religion, of black magicStupas and chörtens must therefore be circumambulated clockwiseThe leftward-spinning eddies spin into the unconscious; the rightward-spinning ones spin out of the unconscious chaosThe rightward-moving swastika in Tibet is therefore a Buddhist emblem(Cfalso Fig.)
For our patient the process appeared to mean, first and foremost, a differentiation of consciousnessFrom the treasures of her psychological knowledge she interpreted the four as the four orienting functions of consciousness: thinking, feeling, sensation, intuitionShe noticed, however, that the four were all alike, whereas the four functions are all unlikeThis raised no question for her, but it did for meWhat are these four if they are not the four functional aspects of consciousness? I doubted whether this could be a sufficient interpretation of themThey seemed to be much more than that, and that is probably the reason why they are not different but identicalThey do not form four functions, different by definition, but they might well represent the a priori possibility for the formation of the four functionsIn this picture we have the quaternity, the archetypal , which is capable of numerous interpretations, as history shows and as I have demonstrated elsewhereIt illustrates the coming to consciousness of an unconscious content; hence it frequently occurs in cosmogonic mythsWhat is the precise significance of the fact that the four eddies are apparently turning to the left, when the division of the mandala into four denotes a process of becoming conscious, is a point about which I would rather not speculateI lack the necessary materialBlue means air or pneuma, and the leftward movement an intensification of the unconscious influencePossibly this should be taken as a pneumatic compensation for the strongly emphasized red colour, which signifies affectivity.
The mandala itself is bright red, but the four eddies have in the main a cool, greenish-blue colour, which the patient associated with water. This might hang together with the leftward movement, since water is a favourite symbol for the unconsciousThe green of the circle in the middle signifies life in the chthonic senseIt is the benedicta viriditas of the alchemists.
The problematical thing about this picture is the fact that the black snake is outside the totality of the symbolic circleIn order to make the totality actual, it ought really to be insideBut if we remember the unfavourable significance of the snake, we shall understand why its assimilation into the symbol of psychic wholeness presents certain difficultiesIf our conjecture about the leftward movement of the four eddies is correct, this would denote a trend towards the deep and dark side of the spirit, by means of which the black snake could be assimilatedThe snake, like the devil in Christian theology, represents the shadow, and one which goes far beyond anything personal and could therefore best be compared with a principle, such as the principle of evilIt is the colossal shadow thrown by man, of which our age had to have such a devastating experienceIt is no easy matter to fit this shadow into our cosmosThe view that we can simply turn our back on evil and in this way eschew it belongs to the long list of antiquated naïvetiesThis is sheer ostrich policy and does not affect the reality of evil in the slightestEvil is the necessary opposite of good, without which there would be no good eitherIt is impossible even to think evil out of existenceHence the fact that the black snake remains outside expresses the critical position of evil in our traditional view of the world.
The background of the picture is pale, the colour of parchmentI mention this fact in particular, as the pictures that follow show a characteristic change in this respect.
The background of Picture  is a cloudy greyThe mandala itself is done in the vividest colours, bright red, green, and blueOnly where the red outer membrane enters the blue-green nucleus does the red deepen to blood colour and the pale blue to a dark ultramarineThe wings of Mercury, missing in the previous picture, reappear here at the neck of the blood-red pistons (as previously on the neck of the black snake in Picture )But the most striking thing is the appearance of a swastika, undoubtedly wheeling to the right(I should add that these pictures were painted in  and had no direct connection with contemporary fantasies, which at that time were still unknown to the world at large.) Because of its green colour, the swastika suggests something plantlike, but at the same time it has the wavelike character of the four eddies in the previous picture.
In this mandala an attempt is made to unite the opposites red and blue, outside and insideSimultaneously, the rightward movement aims at bringing about an ascent into the light of consciousness, presumably because the background has become noticeably darkerThe black snake has disappeared, but has begun to impart its darkness to the entire backgroundTo compensate this, there is in the mandala an upwards movement towards the light, apparently an attempt to rescue consciousness from the darkening of the environmentThe picture was associated with a dream that occurred a few days beforeMiss X dreamt that she returned to the city after a holiday in the countryTo her astonishment she found a tree growing in the middle of the room where she workedShe thought: Well, with its thick bark this tree can withstand the heat of an apartment. Associations to the tree led to its maternal significanceThe tree would explain the plant motif in the mandala, and its sudden growth represents the higher level or freeing of consciousness induced by the movement to the rightFor the same reason the philosophical tree is a symbol of the alchemical opus, which as we know is an individuation process.
We find similar ideas in Justin's gnosisThe angel Baruch stands for the pneuma of Elohim, and the motherly angel Naas for the craftiness of EdemBut both angels, as I have said, were also trees: Baruch the tree of life, Naas the tree of knowledgeTheir division and polarity are in keeping with the spirit of the times (second-third centuries A.D.)But in those days, too, they knew of an individuation process, as we can see from HippolytusElohim, we are told, set the prophet Heracles the task of delivering the Father (the pneuma) from the power of the twelve wicked angelsThis resulted in his twelve laboursNow the Heracles myth has in fact all the characteristic features of an individuation process: the journeys to the four directions, four sons, submission to the feminine principle (Omphale) that symbolizes the unconscious, and the self-sacrifice and rebirth caused by Deianeira's robe.
The thick bark of the tree suggests the motif of protection, which appears in the mandala as the formation of skins (see par)This is expressed in the motif of the protective black bird's wings, which shield the contents of the mandala from outside influencesThe piston-shaped prolongations of the peripheral red substance are phallic symbols, indicating the entry of affectivity into the pneumatic interiorThey are obviously meant to activate and enrich the spirit dwelling withinThis spirit has of course nothing to do with intellect, rather with something that we would have to call spiritual substance (pneuma) or—in modern terms—spiritual life. The underlying symbolical thought is no doubt the same as the view developed in the Clementine Homilies, that ττνεϋμα (spirit) and σώμα (body) are one in GodThe mandala, though only a symbol of the self as the psychic totality, is at the same time a God-image, for the central point, circle, and quaternity are well-known symbols for the deityThe impossibility of distinguishing empirically between self and God leads, in Indian theosophy, to the identity of the personal and supra-personal Purusha-AtmanIn ecclesiastical as in alchemical literature the saying is often quoted: God is an infinite circle (or sphere) whose centre is everywhere and the circumference nowhere. This idea can be found in full development as early as ParmenidesI will cite the passage, because it alludes to the same motifs that underlie our mandala: For the narrower rings were filled with unmixed Fire, and those next to them with Night, but between these rushes the portion of FlameAnd in the centre of these is the goddess who guides everything; for throughout she rules over cruel Birth and Mating, sending the female to mate with the male, and conversely again the male with the female.
The learned Jesuit, Nicholas Caussin, apropos the report in Clement of Alexandria that, on certain occasions, wheels were rolled round in the Egyptian temples, comments that Democritus of Abdera called God  (mentem in igne orbiculari, mind in the spherical fire')He goes on: This was the view also of Parmenides, who defined God as σπφάνην, crown,' a circle consisting of glowing lightAnd it has been very clearly established by Iamblichus, in his book on the mysteries, that the Egyptians customarily represent God, the Lord of the world, as sitting in the lotus, a water-plant, the fruits as well as the leaves of which are round, thereby indicating the circular motion of the mind, which everywhere returns into itself. This is also the origin, he says, of the ritual transformations or circuits (circuitiones) that imitate the motion of the heavensBut the Stoics named the heavens a round and revolving God (rotundum et volubilem Deum)Caussin says it is to this that the mystical (mystice = symbolical) explanation of Psalm  :  refers: In circuitu impii ambulant (the ungodly wander in a circle); they only walk round the periphery without ever reaching the centre, which is GodHere I would mention the wheel motif in mandala symbolism only in passing, as I have dealt with it in detail elsewhere.
In Picture  it has indeed turned to night: the entire sheet which the mandala is painted on is blackAll the light is concentrated in the sphereThe colours have lost their brightness but have gained in intensityIt is especially striking that the black has penetrated as far as the centre, so that something of what we feared has already occurred: the blackness of the snake and of the sombre surroundings has been assimilated by the nucleus and, at the same time, as the picture shows, is compensated by a golden light radiating out from the centreThe rays form an equal-armed cross, to replace the swastika of the previous picture, which is here represented only by four hooks suggesting a rightwards rotationWith the attainment of absolute blackness, and particularly its presence in the centre, the upward movement and rightward rotation seem to have come to an endOn the other hand, the wings of Mercury have undergone a noticeable differentiation, which presumably means that the sphere has sufficient power to keep itself afloat and not sink down into total darknessThe golden rays forming the cross bind the four togetherThis produces an inner bond and consolidation as a defence against destructive influences emanating from the black substance that has penetrated to the centreFor us the cross symbol always has the connotation of suffering, so we are probably not wrong in assuming that the mood of this picture is one of more or less painful suspension—remember the wings!—over the dark abyss of inner loneliness.
Earlier, I mentioned Böhme's lightning that makes a cross, and I brought this cross into connection with the four elementsAs a matter of fact, John Dee symbolizes the elements by an equal-armed crossAs we said, the cross with a little circle in it is the alchemical sign for copper (cuprum, from Kypris, Aphrodite), and the sign for Venus is Remarkably enough, is the old apothecary's sign for spiritus Tartari (tartaric acid), which, literally translated, means spirit of the underworld.' is also the sign for red hematite (bloodstone)Hence there seems to be not only a cross that comes from above, as in Böhme's case and in our mandala, but also one that comes from belowIn other words, the lightning—to keep to Böhme's image—can come from below out of the blood, from Venus or from TartarusBöhme's neutral Salniter is identical with salt in general, and one of the signs for this is One can hardly imagine a better sign for the arcane substance, which salt was considered to be by the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century alchemistsSalt, in ecclesiastical as well as alchemical usage, is the symbol for Sapientia and also for the distinguished or elect personality, as in Matthew  : : Ye are the salt of the earth.
The numerous wavy lines or layers in the mandala could be interpreted as representing the formation of layers of skin, giving protection against outside influencesThey serve the same purpose as the inner consolidationThese cortices probably have something to do with the dream of the tree in the workroom, which had a thick bark. The formation of skins is also found in other mandalas, and it denotes a hardening or sealing off against the outside, the production of a regular rind or hide. It is possible that this phenomenon would account for the cortices or putamina (shards') mentioned in the cabalaFor such is the name for that which abides outside holiness, such as the seven fallen kings and the four AchurayimFrom them come the klippoth or corticesAs in alchemy, these are the scoriae or slag, to which adheres the quality of plurality and of deathIn our mandala the cortices are boundary lines marking off the inner unity and protecting it against the outer blackness with its disintegrating influences, personified by the snakeThe same motif is expressed by the petals of the lotus and by the skins of the onion: the outer layers are withered and desiccated, but they protect the softer, inner layersThe lotus seat of the Horus-child, of the Indian divinities, and of the Buddha must be understood in this senseHölderlin makes use of the same image:
In Christian metaphor, Mary is the flower in which God lies hidden; or again, the rose window in which the rex gloriae and judge of the world is enthroned.
The idea of circular layers is to be found, by implication, in Böhme, for the outermost ring of his three-dimensional mandala is labelled will of ye Devill Lucifer, Abysse (of) Eternity, Abyss of ye Darkness, Hell of Devills, etc(See Fig.) Böhme says of this in his Aurora (chXVII, sec): Behold, when Lucifer with his hosts aroused the Wrath-fire in God's nature, so that God waxed wroth in Nature in the place of Lucifer, the outermost Birth in Nature acquired another Quality, wholly wrathful, dry, cold, vehement, bitter, and sourThe raging Spirit, that before had a subtle, gentle Quality in Nature, became in his outermost Birth wholly presumptuous and terrible, and now in his outermost Birth is called the Wind, or the element Air. In this way the four elements arose—the earth, in particular, by a process of contraction and desiccation.
Cabalistic influences may be conjectured here, though Böhme knew not much more about the Cabala than did ParacelsusHe regarded it as a species of magicThe four elements correspond to the four AchurayimThey constitute a sort of second quaternity, proceeding from the inner, pneumatic quaternity but of a physical natureThe alchemists, too, allude to the AchurayimMennens, for instance, says: And although the holy name of God reveals the Tetragrammaton or the Four Letters, yet if you should look at it aright, only three Letters are found in itThe letter he n is found twice, since they are the same, namely Air and Water, which signifies the Son; Earth the Father, and Fire the Holy GhostThus the Four Letters of God's name manifestly signify the Most Holy Trinity and Matter, which likewise is threefold (triplex) … and which is also called the shadow of the same i.e., of God, and is named by Moyses the back of God Dei posteriora, which seems to be created out of it matter. This statement bears out Böhme's view.
To return to our mandalaThe original four eddies have coalesced into the wavy squares in the middle of the pictureTheir place is taken by golden points at the outer rim (developed from the previous picture), emitting rainbow coloursThese are the colours of the peacock's eye, which play a great role as the cauda pavonis in alchemyThe appearance of these colours in the opus represents an intermediate stage preceding the definitive end resultBöhme speaks of a love-desire or a Beauty of Colours; and here all Colours arise. In our mandala, too, the rainbow colours spring from the red layer that means affectivityOf the life of Nature and Spirit that is united in the spherical wheel Böhme says: Thus is made known to us an eternal Essence of Nature, like to Water and Fire, which stand as it were mixed into one anotherFor there comes a bright-blue colour, like the Lightning of the Fire; and then it has a form like a Ruby mingled with Crystals into one Essence, or like yellow, white, red, and blue mingled in dark Water: for it is like blue in green, since each still has its brightness and shines, and the Water only resists their Fire, so that there is no wasting anywhere, but one eternal Essence in two Mysteries mingled together, notwithstanding the difference of two Principles, viztwo kinds of life. The phenomenon of the colours owes its existence to the Imagination of the great Mystery, where a wondrous essential Life is born.
It is abundantly clear from this that Böhme was preoccupied with the same psychic phenomenon that fascinated Miss X—and many other patients tooAlthough Böhme took the idea of the cauda pavonis and the tetrameria from alchemy, he, like the alchemists, was working on an empirical basis which has since been rediscovered by modern psychologyThere are products of active imagination, and also dreams, which reproduce the same patterns and arrangements with a spontaneity that cannot be influencedA good example is the following dream: A patient dreamt that she was in a drawing-roomThere was a table with three chairs beside itAn unknown man standing beside her invited her to sit downFor this purpose she fetched a fourth chair that stood further offShe then sat at the table and began turning over the pages of a book, containing pictures of blue and red cubes, as for a building gameSuddenly it occurred to her that she had something else to attend toShe left the room and went to a yellow houseIt was raining in torrents, and she sought shelter under a green laurel tree.
The table, the three chairs, the invitation to sit down, the other chair that had to be fetched to make four chairs, the cubes, and the building game all suggest a process of compositionThis takes place in stages: a combination first of blue and red, then of yellow and greenThese four colours symbolize four qualities, as we have seen, which can be interpreted in various waysPsychologically this quaternity points to the orienting functions of consciousness, of which at least one is unconscious and therefore not available for conscious useHere it would be the green, the sensation function, because the patient's relation to the real world was uncommonly complicated and clumsyThe inferior function, however, just because of its unconsciousness, has the great advantage of being contaminated with the collective unconscious and can be used as a bridge to span the gulf between conscious and unconscious and thus restore the vital connection with the latterThis is the deeper reason why the dream represents the inferior function as a laurelThe laurel in this dream has the same connection with the processes of inner growth as the tree that Miss X dreamt grew in her roomIt is essentially the same tree as the arbor philosophica of the alchemists, about which I have written in Psychology and AlchemyWe should also remember that, according to tradition, the laurel is not injured either by lightning or by cold—intacta triumphat. Hence it symbolized the Virgin Mary, the model for all women, just as Christ is the model for menIn view of its historical interpretation the laurel, like the alchemical tree, should be taken in this context as a symbol of the selfThe ingenuousness of patients who produce such dreams is always very impressive.
To turn back again to our mandalaThe golden lines that end in pistons recapitulate the spermatozoon motif and therefore have a spermatic significance, suggesting that the quaternity will be reproduced in a new and more distinct formIn so far as the quaternity has to do with conscious realization, we can infer from these symptoms an intensification of the latter, as is also suggested by the golden light radiating from the centreProbably a kind of inner illumination is meant.
Two days before painting this picture, Miss X dreamt that she was in her father's room in their country houseBut my mother had moved my bed away from the wall into the middle of the room and had slept in itI was furious, and moved the bed back to its former placeIn the dream the bed-cover was red—exactly the red reproduced in the picture.
The mother significance of the tree in her previous dream has here been taken up by the unconscious: this time the mother has slept in the middle of the roomThis seems to be for Miss X an annoying intrusion into her sphere, symbolized by the room of her father, who has an animus significance for herHer sphere is therefore a spiritual one, and she has usurped it just as she usurped her father's roomShe has thus identified with the spirit. Into this sphere her mother has intruded and installed herself in the centre, at first under the symbol of the treeShe therefore stands for physis opposed to spirit, i.e., for the natural feminine being which the dreamer also is, but which she would not accept because it appeared to her as a black snakeAlthough she remedied the intrusion at once, the dark chthonic principle, the black substance, has nevertheless penetrated to the centre of her mandala, as Picture  showsBut just because of this the golden light can appear: e tenebris lux! We have to relate the mother to Böhme's idea of the matrixFor him the matrix is the sine qua non of all differentiation or realization, without which the spirit remains suspended and never comes down to earthThe collision between the paternal and the maternal principle (spirit and nature) works like a shock.
After this picture, she felt the renewed penetration of the red colour, which she associated with feeling, as something disturbing, and she now discovered that her rapport with me, her analyst (= father), was unnatural and unsatisfactoryShe was giving herself airs, she said, and was posing as an intelligent, understanding pupil (usurpation of spirituality!)But she had to admit that she felt very silly and was very silly, regardless of what I thought about itThis admission brought her a feeling of great relief and helped her to see at last that sex was not, on the one hand, merely a mechanism for producing children and not, on the other, only an expression of supreme passion, but was also banally physiological and autoerotic. This belated realization led her straight into a fantasy state where she became conscious of a series of obscene imagesAt the end she saw the image of a large bird, which she called the earth bird, and which alighted on the earthBirds, as aerial beings, are well-known spirit symbolsIt represented the transformation of the spiritual image of herself into a more earthy version that is more characteristic of womenThis tailpiece confirms our suspicion that the intensive upward and rightward movement has come to a halt: the bird is coming down to earthThis symbolization denotes a further and necessary differentiation of what Böhme describes in general as Love-desire. Through this differentiation consciousness is not only widened but also brought face to face with the reality of things, so that the inner experience is tied, so to speak, to a definite spot.
On the days following, the patient was overcome by feelings of self-pityIt became clear to her how much she regretted never having had any childrenShe felt like a neglected animal or a lost childThis mood grew into a regular Weltschmerz, and she felt like the all-compassionate Tathagata (Buddha), Only when she had completely given way to these feelings could she bring herself to paint another pictureReal liberation comes not from glossing over or repressing painful states of feeling, but only from experiencing them to the full.
The thing that strikes us at once in Picture  is that almost the whole interior is filled with the black substanceThe blue-green of the water has condensed to a dark blue quaternity, and the golden light in the centre turns in the reverse direction, anti-clockwise: the bird is coming down to earthThat is, the mandala is moving towards the dark, chthonic depthsIt is still floating—the wings of Mercury show this—but it has come much closer to the blacknessThe inner, undifferentiated quaternity is balanced by an outer, differentiated one, which Miss X equated with the four functions of consciousnessTo these she assigned the following colours: yellow = intuition, light blue = thinking, flesh pink = feeling, brown = sensationEach of these quarters is divided into three, thus producing the number  againThe separation and characterization of the two quaternities is worth notingThe outer quaternity of wings appears as a differentiated realization of the undifferentiated inner one, which really represents the archetypeIn the cabala this relationship corresponds to the quaternity of Merkabah on the one hand and of the Achurayim on the other, and in Böhme they are the four Spirits of God and the four elements.
The plantlike form of the cross in the middle of the mandala, also noted by the patient, refers back to the tree (tree of the cross) and the motherShe thus makes it clear that this previously taboo element has been accepted and now holds the central placeShe was fully conscious of this—which of course was a great advance on her previous attitude.
In contrast to the previous picture there are no inner corticesThis is a logical development, because the thing they were meant to exclude is now in the centre, and defence has become superfluousInstead, the cortices spread out into the darkness as golden rings, expanding concentrically like wavesThis would mean a far-reaching influence on the environment emanating from the sealed-off self.
Four days before she painted this mandala she had the following dream: I drew a young man to the window and, with a brush dipped in white oil, removed a black fleck from the cornea of his eyeA little golden lamp then became visible in the centre of the pupilThe young man felt greatly relieved, and I told him he should come again for treatmentI woke up saying the words: If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.'S (Matthew  : .)
This dream describes the change: the patient is no longer identical with her animusThe animus has, so to speak, become her patient, since he has eye troubleAs a matter of fact the animus usually sees things cock-eyed and often very unclearlyHere a black fleck on the cornea obscures the golden light shining from inside the eyeHe has seen things too blackly. The eye is the prototype of the mandala, as is evident from Böhme, who calls his mandala The Philosophique Globe, or Eye of ye Wonders of Eternity, or Looking-Glass of Wisdom. He says: The substance and Image of the Soul may be resembled to the Earth, having a fair Flower growing out of it, and also to the Fire and Light; as we see that Earth is a Centre, but no life; yet it is essential, and a fair flower grows out of it, which is not like Earth … and yet the Earth is the Mother of the Flower. The soul is a fiery Eye, and similitude of the First Principle, a Centre of Nature.
Our mandala is indeed an eye, the structure of which symbolizes the centre of order in the unconsciousThe eye is a hollow sphere, black inside, and filled with a semi-liquid substance, the vitreous humourLooking at it from outside, one sees a round, coloured surface, the iris, with a dark centre, from which a golden light shinesBöhme calls it a fiery eye, in accordance with the old idea that seeing emanates from the eyeThe eye may well stand for consciousness (which is in fact an organ of perception), looking into its own backgroundIt sees its own light there, and when this is clear and pure the whole body is filled with lightUnder certain conditions consciousness has a purifying effectThis is probably what is meant by Matthew  : ff., an idea expressed even more clearly in Luke : Ï.
The eye is also a well-known symbol for GodHence Böhme calls his Philosophique Globe the Eye of Eternity, the Essence of all Essences, the Eye of God.
By accepting the darkness, the patient has not, to be sure, changed it into light, but she has kindled a light that illuminates the darkness withinBy day no light is needed, and if you don't know it is night you won't light one, nor will any light be lit for you unless you have suffered the horror of darknessThis is not an edifying text but a mere statement of the psychological factsThe transition from Picture  to Picture  gives one a working idea of what I mean by accepting the dark principle. It has sometimes been objected that nobody can form a clear conception of what this means, which is regrettable, because it is an ethical problem of the first orderHere, then, is a practical example of this acceptance, and I must leave it to the philosophers to puzzle out the ethical aspects of the process.
In Picture  we see for the first time the blue soul-flower, on a red background, also described as such by Miss X (naturally without knowledge of Böhme)In the centre is the golden light in the form of a lamp, as she herself statedThe cortices are very pronounced, but they consist of light (at least in the upper half of the mandala) and radiate outwardsThe light is composed of the rainbow hues of the rising sun; it is a real cauda pavonisThere are six sets of sunbeamsThis recalls the Buddha's Discourse on the Robe, from the Collection of the Pali Canon:
His heart overflowing with lovingkindness … with compassion … with joyfulness … with equanimity, he abides, raying forth lovingkindness, compassion, joyfulness, equanimity, towards one quarter of space, then towards the second, then towards the third, then towards the fourth, and above and below, thus, all aroundEverywhere, into all places the wide world over, his heart overflowing with compassion streams forth, wide, deep, illimitable, free from enmity, free from all ill-will….
But a parallel with the Buddhist East cannot be carried through here, because the mandala is divided into an upper and a lower halfAbove, the rings shine many-hued as a rainbow; below, they consist of brown earthAbove, there hover three white birds (pneumata signifying the Trinity); below, a goat is rising up, accompanied by two ravens (Wotan's birds) and twining snakesThis is not the sort of picture a Buddhist holy man would make, but that of a Western person with a Christian background, whose light throws a dark shadowWhat is more, the three birds float in a jet black sky, and the goat, rising out of dark clay, is shown against a field of bright orangeThis, oddly enough, is the colour of the Buddhist monk's robe, which was certainly not a conscious intention of the patientThe underlying thought is clear: no white without black, and no holiness without the devilOpposites are brothers, and the Oriental seeks to liberate himself from them by his nirdvandva (free from the two) and his neti neti (not this, not that), or else he puts up with them in some mysterious fashion, as in TaoismThe connection with the East is deliberately stressed by the patient, through her painting into the mandala four hexagrams from the I Ching.
The sign in the left top half is Yü, ENTHUSIASM (NO)It means Thunder comes resounding out of the earth, i.e., a movement coming from the unconscious, and expressed by music and dancingConfucius comments as follows:
The second hexagram at the top is Sun, DECREASE (NO)The upper trigram means Mountain, the lower trigram means LakeThe mountain towers above the lake and restrains itThat is the image whose interpretation points to self-restraint and reserve, i.e., a seeming decrease of oneselfThis is significant in the light of ENTHUSIASM. In the top line of the hexagram, But one no longer has a separate home, the homelessness of the Buddhist monk is meantOn the psychological level this does not, of course, refer to so drastic a demonstration of renunciation and independence, but to the patient's irreversible insight into the conditioned quality of all relationships, into the relativity of all values, and the transience of all things.
The sign in the bottom half to the right is Sheng, PUSHING UPWARD (No)Within the earth, wood grows: The image of Pushing Upward. It also says: One pushes upward into an empty city, and The king offers him Mount Ch'i. So this hexagram means growth and development of the personality, like a plant pushing out of the earth—a theme already anticipated by the plant motif in an earlier mandalaThis is an allusion to the important lesson which Miss X has learnt from her experience: that there is no development unless the shadow is accepted.
The hexagram to the left is Ting, THE CAULDRON (No)This is a bronze sacrificial vessel equipped with handles and legs, which held the cooked viands used for festive occasionsThe lower trigram means Wind and Wood, the upper one FireThe Cauldron is thus made up of fire over wood, just as the alchemical vessel consists of fire or waterThere is delicious food in it (the fat of the pheasant), but it is not eaten because the handle of the ting is altered and its legs are broken, making it unusableBut, as a result of constant self-abnegation, the personality becomes differentiated (the ting has golden carrying rings and even rings of jade) and purified, until it acquires the hardness and soft lustre of precious jade.
Though the four hexagrams were put into the mandala on purpose, they are authentic results of preoccupation with the I ChingThe phases and aspects of my patient's inner process of development can therefore express themselves easily in the language of the I Ching, because it too is based on the psychology of the individuation process that forms one of the main interests of Taoism and of Zen BuddhismMiss X's interest in Eastern philosophy was due to the deep impression which a better knowledge of her life and of herself had made upon her—an impression of the tremendous contradictions in human natureThe insoluble conflict she was faced with makes her preoccupation with Eastern therapeutic systems, which seem to get along without conflict, doubly interestingIt may be partly due to this acquaintance with the East that the opposites, irreconcilable in Christianity, were not blurred or glossed over, but were seen in all their sharpness, and in spite (or perhaps just because) of this, were brought together into the unity of the mandalaBöhme was never able to achieve this union; on the contrary, in his mandala the bright and dark semi-circles are turned back to backThe bright half is labelled HGhost, the dark half Father, i.e., auctor rerum or First Principle, whereas the Holy Ghost is the Second Principle. This polarity is crossed by the paired opposites Sonne and Earthly Man. The Devills are all on the side of the dark Father and constitute his Wrath-fire, just as on the periphery of the mandala.
Böhme's starting-point was philosophical alchemy, and to my knowledge he was the first to try to organize the Christian cosmos, as a total reality, into a mandalaThe attempt failed, inasmuch as he was unable to unite the two halves in a circleMiss X's mandala, on the other hand, comprises and contains the opposites, as a result, we may suppose, of the support afforded by the Chinese doctrine of Yang and Yin, the two metaphysical principles whose co-operation makes the world go roundThe hexagrams, with their firm (yang) and yielding (yin) lines, illustrate certain phases of this processIt is therefore right that they should occupy a mediating position between above and belowLao-tzu says: High stands on low. This indisputable truth is secretly suggested in the mandala: the three white birds hover in a black field, but the grey-black goat has a bright orange-coloured backgroundThus the Oriental truth insinuates itself and makes possible—at least by symbolic anticipation—a union of opposites within the irrational life process formulated by the I ChingThat we are really concerned here with opposite phases of one and the same process is shown by the picture that now follows.
In Picture , begun in Zurich but only completed when Miss X again visited her motherland, we find the same division as before into above and belowThe soul-flower in the centre is the same, but it is surrounded on all sides by a dark blue night sky, in which we see the four phases of the moon, the new moon coinciding with the world of darkness belowThe three birds have become twoTheir plumage has darkened, but on the other hand the goat has turned into two semi-human creatures with horns and light faces, and only two of the four snakes remainA notable innovation is the appearance of two crabs in the lower, chthonic hemisphere that also represents the bodyThe crab has essentially the same meaning as the astrological sign CancerUnfortunately Miss X gave no context hereIn such cases it is usually worth investigating what use has been made in the past of the object in questionIn earlier, prescientific ages hardly any distinction was drawn between longtailed crabs (Macrura, crayfish) and short-tailed crabs (Brachyura)As a zodiacal sign Cancer signifies resurrection, because the crab sheds its shellThe ancients had in mind chiefly Pagurus bernhardus, the hermit crabIt hides in its shell and cannot be attackedTherefore it signifies caution and foresight, knowledge of coming eventsIt depends on the moon, and waxes with it. It is worth noting that the crab appears just in the mandala in which we see the phases of the moon for the first timeAstrologically, Cancer is the house of the moonBecause of its backwards and sideways movement, it plays the role of an unlucky animal in superstition and colloquial speech (crabbed, catch a crab, etc.)Since ancient times cancer (καρκίνοή has been the name for a malignant tumour of the glandsCancer is the zodiacal sign in which the sun begins to retreat, when the days grow shorterPseudo-Kallisthenes relates that crabs dragged Alexander's ships down into the seaKarkinos was the name of the crab that bit Heracles in the foot in his fight with the Lernaean monsterIn gratitude, Hera set her accomplice among the stars.
In astrology, Cancer is a feminine and watery sign, and the summer solstice takes place in itIn the melothesiae it is correlated with the breastIt rules over the Western seaIn Propertius it makes a sinister appearance: Octipedis Cancri terga sinistra time (Fear thou the ill-omened back of the eight-footed crab)De Gubernatis says: The crab … causes now the death of the solar hero and now that of the monster. The Panchatantra (V, ) relates how a crab, which the mother gave to her son as apotropaic magic, saved his life by killing a black snakeAs De Gubernatis thinks, the crab stands now for the sun and now for the moon, according to whether it goes forwards or backwards.
Miss X was born in the first degrees of Cancer (actually about °)She knew her horoscope and was well aware of the significance of the moment of birth; that is, she realized that the degree of the rising sign (the ascendent) conditions the individuality of the horoscopeSince she obviously guessed the horoscope's affinity with the mandala, she introduced her individual sign into the painting that was meant to express her psychic self.
The essential conclusion to be drawn from Picture  is that the dualities which run through it are always inwardly balanced, so that they lose their sharpness and incompatibilityAs Multatuli says: Nothing is quite true, and even that is not quite true. But this loss of strength is counterbalanced by the unity of the centre, where the lamp shines, sending out coloured rays to the eight points of the compass.
Although the attainment of inner balance through symmetrical pairs of opposites was probably the main intention of this mandala, we should not overlook the fact that the duplication motif also occurs when unconscious contents are about to become conscious and differentiatedThey then split, as often happens in dreams, into two identical or slightly different halves corresponding to the conscious and still unconscious aspects of the nascent contentI have the impression, from this picture, that it really does represent a kind of solstice or climax, where decision and division take placeThe dualities are, at bottom, Yes and No, the irreconcilable opposites, but they have to be held together if the balance of life is to be maintainedThis can only be done by holding unswervingly to the centre, where action and suffering balance each otherIt is a path sharp as the edge of a razor. A climax like this, where universal opposites clash, is at the same time a moment when a wide perspective often opens out into the past and futureThis is the psychological moment when, as the consensus gentium has established since ancient times, synchronistic phenomena occur—that is, when the far appears near: sixteen years later, Miss X became fatally ill with cancer of the breast.
Here I will only mention that the coloured rays emanating from the centre have become so rarified that, in the next few pictures, they disappear altogetherSun and moon are now outside, no longer included in the microcosm of the mandalaThe sun is not golden, but has a dull, ochrous hue and in addition is clearly turning to the left: it is moving towards its own obscuration, as had to happen after the cancer picture (solstice)The moon is in the first quarterThe roundish masses near the sun are probably meant to be cumulus clouds, but with their grey-red hues they look suspiciously like bulbous swellingsThe interior of the mandala now contains a quincunx of stars, the central star being silver and goldThe division of the mandala into an aerial and an earthy hemisphere has transferred itself to the outside world and can no longer be seen in the interiorThe silvery rim of the aerial hemisphere in the preceding picture now runs round the entire mandala and recalls the band of quicksilver that, as Mercurius vulgaris, veils the true personality. At all events, it is probable that the influence and importance of the outside world are becoming so strong in this picture as to bring about an impairment and devaluation of the mandalaIt does not break down or burst (as can easily happen under similar circumstances), but is removed from the telluric influence through the symbolical constellation of stars and heavenly bodies.
In Picture  the sun is in fact sinking below the horizon and the moon is coming out of the first quarterThe radiation of the mandala has ceased altogether, but the equivalents of sun and moon, and also of the earth, have been assimilated into itA remarkable feature is its sudden inner animation by two human figures and various animalsThe constellation character of the centre has vanished and given way to a kind of flower motifWhat this animation means cannot be established, unfortunately, as we have no commentary.
In Picture  the source of radiation is no longer in the mandala but outside, in the shape of the full moon, from which rings of rainbow-coloured light radiate in concentric circlesThe mandala is laced together by four black and golden snakes, the heads of three of them pointing to the centre, while the fourth rears upwardsIn between the snakes and the centre there are indications of the spermatozoon motifThis may mean an intensive penetration on the part of the outside world, but it could also mean magical protectionThe breaking down of the quaternity into  plus  is in accord with the archetype.
In Picture  the mandala is suspended over the lit-up ravine of Fifth Avenue, New York, whither Miss X in the meantime returnedOn the blue flower in the centre the coniunctio of the royal pair is represented by the sacrificial fire burning between themThe King and Queen are assisted by two kneeling figures of a man and a womanIt is a typical marriage quaternio, and for an understanding of its psychology I must refer the reader to my account in the Psychology of the Transference. This inner bond should be thought of as a compensatory consolidation against disintegrating influences from without.
In Picture  the mandala floats between Manhattan and the seaIt is daylight again, and the sun is just risingOut of the blue centre blue snakes penetrate into the red flesh of the mandala: the enantiodromia is setting in, after the introversion of feeling caused by the shock of New York had passed its climaxThe blue colour of the snakes indicates that they have acquired a pneumatic nature.
From Picture  onwards, the drawing and painting technique shows a decided improvementThe mandalas gain in aesthetic valueIn Picture  a kind of eye motif appears, which I have also observed in the mandalas of other personsIt seems to me to link up with the motif of polyophthalmia and to point to the peculiar nature of the unconscious, which can be regarded as a multiple consciousness. I have discussed this question in detail elsewhere(See also Fig.)
Aged , artistic and technically accomplishedIn the centre is the egg encircled by the snake; outside, apotropaic wings and eyesThe mandala is exceptional in that it has a pentadic structure(The patient also produced triadic mandalasShe was fond of playing with forms irrespective of their meaning—a consequence of her artistic gift.)
The enantiodromia only reached its climax the following year, in Picture In that picture the red substance is arranged round the golden, four-rayed star in the centre, and the blue substance is pushing everywhere to the peripheryHere the rainbow-coloured radiation of the mandala begins again for the first time, and from then on was maintained for over ten years (in mandalas not reproduced here).
I will not comment on the subsequent pictures, nor reproduce them all—as I say, they extend over more than ten years—because I feel I do not understand them properlyIn addition, they came into my hands only recently, after the death of the patient, and unfortunately without text or commentaryUnder these circumstances the work of interpretation becomes very uncertain, and is better left unattemptedAlso, this case was meant only as an example of how such pictures come to be produced, what they mean, and what reflections and observations their interpretation requiresIt is not intended to demonstrate how an entire lifetime expresses itself in symbolic formThe individuation process has many stages and is subject to many vicissitudes, as the fictive course of the opus alchymicum amply shows.
Our series of pictures illustrates the initial stages of the way of individuationIt would be desirable to know what happens afterwardsBut, just as neither the philosophical gold nor the philosophers' stone was ever made in reality, so nobody has ever been able to tell the story of the whole way, at least not to mortal ears, for it is not the story-teller but death who speaks the final consummatum est. Certainly there are many things worth knowing in the later stages of the process, but, from the point of view of teaching as well as of therapy, it is important not to skip too quickly over the initial stagesAs these pictures are intuitive anticipations of future developments, it is worth while lingering over them for a long time, in order, with their help, to integrate so many contents of the unconscious into consciousness that the latter really does reach the stage it sees aheadThese psychic evolutions do not as a rule keep pace with the tempo of intellectual developmentsIndeed, their very first goal is to bring a consciousness that has hurried too far ahead into contact again with the unconscious background with which it should be connectedThis was the problem in our case tooMiss X had to turn back to her motherland in order to find her earth again—vestigia retro! It is a task that today faces not only individuals but whole civilizationsWhat else is the meaning of the frightful regressions of our time? The tempo of the development of consciousness through science and technology was too rapid and left the unconscious, which could no longer keep up with it, far behind, thereby forcing it into a defensive position which expresses itself in a universal will to destructionThe political and social isms of our day preach every conceivable ideal, but, under this mask, they pursue the goal of lowering the level of our culture by restricting or altogether inhibiting the possibilities of individual developmentThey do this partly by creating a chaos controlled by terrorism, a primitive state of affairs that affords only the barest necessities of life and surpasses in horror the worst times of the so-called Dark AgesIt remains to be seen whether this experience of degradation and slavery will once more raise a cry for greater spiritual freedom.
This problem cannot be solved collectively, because the masses are not changed unless the individual changesAt the same time, even the best-looking solution cannot be forced upon him, since it is a good solution only when it is combined with a natural process of developmentIt is therefore a hopeless undertaking to stake everything on collective recipes and proceduresThe bettering of a general ill begins with the individual, and then only when he makes himself and not others responsibleThis is naturally only possible in freedom, but not under a rule of force, whether this be exercised by a self-elected tyrant or by one thrown up by the mob.
The initial pictures in our series illustrate the characteristic psychic processes which set in the moment one gives a mind to that part of the personality which has remained behind, forgottenScarcely has the connection been established when symbols of the self appear, trying to convey a picture of the total personalityAs a result of this development, the unsuspecting modern gets into paths trodden from time immemorial—the via sancta, whose milestones and signposts are the religionsHe will think and feel things that seem strange to him, not to say unpleasantApuleius relates that in the Isis mysteries he approached the very gates of death and set one foot on Proserpina's threshold, yet was permitted to return, rapt through all the elementsAt midnight I saw the sun shining as if it were noon; I entered the presence of the gods of the underworld and the gods of the upper world, stood near and worshipped them. Such experiences are also expressed in our mandalas; that is why we find in religious literature the best parallels to the symbols and moods of the situations they formulateThese situations are intense inner experiences which can lead to lasting psychic growth and a ripening and deepening of the personality, if the individual affected by them has the moral capacity for πίστπ, loyal trust and confidenceThey are the age-old psychic experiences that underlie faith and ought to be its unshakable foundation—and not of faith alone, but also of knowledge.
Our case shows with singular clarity the spontaneity of the psychic process and the transformation of a personal situation into the problem of individuation, that is, of becoming whole, which is the answer to the great question of our day: How can consciousness, our most recent acquisition, which has bounded ahead, be linked up again with the oldest, the unconscious, which has lagged behind? The oldest of all is the instinctual foundationAnyone who overlooks the instincts will be ambuscaded by them, and anyone who does not humble himself will be humbled, losing at the same time his freedom, his most precious possession.
Always when science tries to describe a simple life-process, the matter becomes complicated and difficultSo it is no wonder that the details of a transformation process rendered visible through active imagination make no small demands on our understandingIn this respect they may be compared with all other biological processesThese, too, require specialized knowledge to become comprehensibleOur example also shows, however, that this process can begin and run its course without any special knowledge having to stand sponsor to itBut if one wants to understand anything of it and assimilate it into consciousness, then a certain amount of knowledge is neededIf the process is not understood at all, it has to build up an unusual intensity so as not to sink back again into the unconscious without resultBut if its affects rise to an unusual pitch, they will enforce some kind of understandingIt depends on the correctness of this understanding whether the consequences turn out more pathologically or lessPsychic experiences, according to whether they are rightly or wrongly understood, have very different effects on a person's developmentIt is one of the duties of the psychotherapist to acquire such knowledge of these things as will enable him to help his patient to an adequate understandingExperiences of this kind are not without their dangers, for they are also, among other things, the matrix of the psychosesStiffnecked and violent interpretations should under all circumstances be avoided, likewise a patient should never be forced into a development that does not come naturally and spontaneouslyBut once it has set in, he should not be talked out of it again, unless the possibility of a psychosis has been definitely establishedThorough psychiatric experience is needed to decide this question, and it must constantly be borne in mind that the constellation of archetypal images and fantasies is not in itself pathologicalThe pathological element only reveals itself in the way the individual reacts to them and how he interprets themThe characteristic feature of a pathological reaction is, above all, identification with the archetypeThis produces a sort of inflation and possession by the emergent contents, so that they pour out in a torrent which no therapy can stopIdentification can, in favourable cases, sometimes pass off as a more or less harmless inflationBut in all cases identification with the unconscious brings a weakening of consciousness, and herein lies the dangerYou do not make an identification, you do not identify yourself, but you experience your identity with the archetype in an unconscious way and so are possessed by itHence in more difficult cases it is far more necessary to strengthen and consolidate the ego than to understand and assimilate the products of the unconsciousThe decision must be left to the diagnostic and therapeutic tact of the analyst.
This paper is a groping attempt to make the inner processes of the mandala more intelligibleThey are, as it were, self-delineations of dimly sensed changes going on in the background, which are perceived by the reversed eye and rendered visible with pencil and brush, just as they are, uncomprehended and unknownThe pictures represent a kind of ideogram of unconscious contentsI have naturally used this method on myself too and can affirm that one can paint very complicated pictures without having the least idea of their real meaningWhile painting them, the picture seems to develop out of itself and often in opposition to one's conscious intentionsIt is interesting to observe how the execution of the picture frequently thwarts one's expectations in the most surprising wayThe same thing can be observed, sometimes even more clearly, when writing down the products of active imagination.
The present work may also serve to fill a gap I myself have felt in my exposition of therapeutic methodsI have written very little on active imagination, but have talked about it a great dealI have used this method since , and I sketched it out for the first time in The Relations between the Ego and the Unconscious. I first mentioned the mandala in , in The Secret of the Golden FlowerFor at least thirteen years I kept quiet about the results of these methods in order to avoid any suggestionI wanted to assure myself that these things—mandalas especially—really are produced spontaneously and were not suggested to the patient by my own fantasyI was then able to convince myself, through my own studies, that mandalas were drawn, painted, carved in stone, and built, at all times and in all parts of the world, long before my patients discovered themI have also seen to my satisfaction that mandalas are dreamt and drawn by patients who were being treated by psychotherapists whom I had not trainedIn view of the importance and significance of the mandala symbol, special precautions seemed to be necessary, seeing that this motif is one of the best examples of the universal operation of an archetypeIn a seminar on children's dreams, which I held in –, I mentioned the dream of a ten-year-old girl who had absolutely no possibility of ever hearing about the quaternity of GodThe dream was written down by the child herself and was sent to me by an acquaintance: Once in a dream I saw an animal that had lots of hornsIt spiked up other little animals with themIt wriggled like a snake and that was how it livedThen a blue fog came out of all the four corners, and it stopped eatingThen God came, but there were really four Gods in the four cornersThen the animal died, and all the animals it had eaten came out alive again.
This dream describes an unconscious individuation process: all the animals are eaten by the one animalThen comes the enantiodromia: the dragon changes into pneuma, which stands for a divine quaternityThereupon follows the apocatastasis, a resurrection of the deadThis exceedingly unchildish fantasy can hardly be termed anything but archetypalMiss X, in Picture , also put a whole collection of animals into her mandala—two snakes, two tortoises, two fishes, two lions, two pigs, a goat and a ramIntegration gathers many into oneTo the child who had this dream, and to Miss X likewise, it was certainly not known that Origen had already said (speaking of the sacrificial animals): Seek these sacrifices within thyself, and thou wilt find them within thine own soulUnderstand that thou hast within thyself flocks of cattle … flocks of sheep and flocks of goats… Understand that the birds of the sky are also within theeMarvel not if we say that these are within thee, but understand that thou thyself art even another little world, and hast within thee the sun and the moon, and also the stars.
The same idea occurs again in another passage, but this time it takes the form of a psychological statement: For look upon the countenance of a man who is at one moment angry, at the next sad, a short while afterward joyful, then troubled again, and then contented… See how he who thinks himself one is not one, but seems to have as many personalities as he has moods, as also the Scripture says: A fool is changed as the moon… God, therefore, is unchangeable, and is called one for the reason that he changes notThus also the true imitator of God, who is made after God's image, is called one and the selfsame unus et ipse when he comes to perfection, for he also, when he is fixed on the summit of virtue, is not changed, but remains alway oneFor every man, whiles he is in wickedness malitia, is divided among many things and torn in many directions; and while he is in many kinds of evil he cannot be called one.
Here the many animals are affective states to which man is proneThe individuation process, clearly alluded to in this passage, subordinates the many to the OneBut the One is God, and that which corresponds to him in us is the imago Dei, the God-imageBut the God-image, as we saw from Jakob Böhme, expresses itself in the mandala.
In what follows I shall try to describe a special category of symbols, the mandala, with the help of a wide selection of picturesI have dealt with this theme on several occasions before, and in Psychology and Alchemy I gave a detailed account, with running commentary, of the mandala symbols that came up in the course of an individual analysisI repeated the attempt in the preceding paper of the present volume, but there the mandalas did not derive from dreams but from active imaginationIn this paper I shall present mandalas of the most varied provenance, on the one hand to give the reader an impression of the astonishing wealth of forms produced by individual fantasy, and on the other hand to enable him to form some idea of the regular occurrence of the basic elements.
As regards the interpretation, I must refer the reader to the literatureIn this paper I shall content myself with hints, because a more detailed explanation would lead much too far, as the mandalas described in Psychology and Religion and in the preceding paper of this volume show.
The Sanskrit word mandala means circle.' It is the Indian term for the circles drawn in religious ritualsIn the great temple of Madura, in southern India, I saw how a picture of this kind was madeIt was drawn by a woman on the floor of the mandapam (porch), in coloured chalks, and measured about ten feet acrossA pandit who accompanied me said in reply to my questions that he could give me no information about itOnly the women who drew such pictures knew what they meantThe woman herself was non-committal; she evidently did not want to be disturbed in her workElaborate mandalas, executed in red chalk, can also be found on the whitewashed walls of many hutsThe best and most significant mandalas are found in the sphere of Tibetan BuddhismI shall use as an example a Tibetan mandala, to which my attention was drawn by Richard Wilhelm.
A mandala of this sort is known in ritual usage as a yantra, an instrument of contemplationIt is meant to aid concentration by narrowing down the psychic field of vision and restricting it to the centreUsually the mandala contains three circles, painted in black or dark blueThey are meant to shut out the outside and hold the inside togetherAlmost regularly the outer rim consists of fire, the fire of concupiscentia, desire,' from which proceed the torments of hellThe horrors of the burial ground are generally depicted on the outer rimInside this is a garland of lotus leaves, characterizing the whole mandala as a padma, lotus-flower.' Then comes a kind of monastery courtyard with four gatesIt signifies sacred seclusion and concentrationInside this courtyard there are as a rule the four basic colours, red, green, white, and yellow, which represent the four directions and also the psychic functions, as the Tibetan Book of the Dead showsThen, usually marked off by another magic circle, comes the centre as the essential object or goal of contemplation.
This centre is treated in very different ways, depending on the requirements of the ritual, the grade of initiation of the contemplator, and the sect he belongs toAs a rule it shows Shiva in his world-creating emanationsShiva, according to Tantric doctrine, is the One Existent, the Timeless in its perfect stateCreation begins when this unextended point—known as Shiva-bindu—appears in the eternal embrace of its feminine side, the ShaktiIt then emerges from the state of being-in-itself and attains the state of being-for-itself, if I may use the Hegelian terminology.
In kundalini yoga symbolism, Shakti is represented as a snake wound three and a half times round the lingam, which is Shiva in the form of a phallusThis image shows the possibility of manifestation in spaceFrom Shakti comes Maya, the building material of all individual things; she is, in consequence, the creatrix of the real worldThis is thought of as illusion, as being and not-beingIt is, and yet remains dissolved in ShivaCreation therefore begins with an act of division of the opposites that are united in the deityFrom their splitting arises, in a gigantic explosion of energy, the multiplicity of the world.
The goal of contemplating the processes depicted in the mandala is that the yogi shall become inwardly aware of the deityThrough contemplation, he recognizes himself as God again, and thus returns from the illusion of individual existence into the universal totality of the divine state.
As I have said, mandala means circle.' There are innumerable variants of the motif shown here, but they are all based on the squaring of a circleTheir basic motif is the premonition of a centre of personality, a kind of central point within the psyche, to which everything is related, by which everything is arranged, and which is itself a source of energyThe energy of the central point is manifested in the almost irresistible compulsion and urge to become what one is, just as every organism is driven to assume the form that is characteristic of its nature, no matter what the circumstancesThis centre is not felt or thought of as the ego but, if one may so express it, as the selfAlthough the centre is represented by an innermost point, it is surrounded by a periphery containing everything that belongs to the self—the paired opposites that make up the total personalityThis totality comprises consciousness first of all, then the personal unconscious, and finally an indefinitely large segment of the collective unconscious whose archetypes are common to all mankindA certain number of these, however, are permanently or temporarily included within the scope of the personality and, through this contact, acquire an individual stamp as the shadow, anima, and animus, to mention only the best-known figuresThe self, though on the one hand simple, is on the other hand an extremely composite thing, a conglomerate soul, to use the Indian expression.
Lamaic literature gives very detailed instructions as to how such a circle must be painted and how it should be usedForm and colour are laid down by tradition, so the variants move within fairly narrow limitsThe ritual use of the mandala is actually non-Buddhist; at any rate it is alien to the original Hínayāna Buddhism and appears first in Mahāyāna Buddhism.
The mandala shown here depicts the state of one who has emerged from contemplation into the absolute stateThat is why representation of hell and the horrors of the burial ground are missingThe diamond thunderbolt, the dorje in the centre, symbolizes the perfect state where masculine and feminine are unitedThe world of illusions has finally vanishedAll energy has gathered together in the initial state.
The four dorjes in the gates of the inner courtyard are meant to indicate that life's energy is streaming inwards; it has detached itself from objects and now returns to the centreWhen the perfect union of all energies in the four aspects of wholeness is attained, there arises a static state subject to no more changeIn Chinese alchemy this state is called the Diamond Body, corresponding to the corpus incorruptibile of medieval alchemy, which is identical with the corpus glorificationis of Christian tradition, the incorruptible body of resurrectionThis mandala shows, then, the union of all opposites, and is embedded between yang and yin, heaven and earth; the state of everlasting balance and immutable duration.
For our more modest psychological purposes we must abandon the colourful metaphysical language of the EastWhat yoga aims at in this exercise is undoubtedly a psychic change in the adeptThe ego is the expression of individual existenceThe yogin exchanges his ego for Shiva or the Buddha; in this way he induces a shifting of the psychological centre of personality from the personal ego to the impersonal non-ego, which is now experienced as the real Ground of the personality.
In this connection I would like to mention a similar Chinese conception, namely the system on which the I Ching is based.
Round this masculine power-centre lies the earth with its formed elementsIt is the same conception as the Shiva-Shakti union in kundalini yoga, but here represented as the earth receiving into itself the creative power of heavenThe union of heaven with kun, the feminine and receptive, produces the tetraktys, which, as in Pythagoras, underlies all existence.
The River Map is one of the legendary foundations of the I Ching, which in its present form derives partly from the twelfth century B.CAccording to the legend, a dragon dredged the magical signs of the River Map from a riverOn it the sages discovered the drawing, and in the drawing the laws of the world-orderThis drawing, in accordance with its extreme age, shows the knotted cords that signify numbersThese numbers have the usual primitive character of qualities, chiefly masculine and feminineAll uneven numbers are masculine, even numbers feminine.
Unfortunately I do not know whether this primitive conception influenced the formation of the much younger Tantric mandalaBut the parallels are so striking that the European investigator has to ask himself: Which view influenced the other? Did the Chinese develop from the Indian, or the Indian from the Chinese? An Indian whom I asked answered: Naturally the Chinese developed from the Indian. But he did not know how old the Chinese conceptions areThe bases of the I Ching go back to the third millennium B.CMy late friend Richard Wilhelm, the eminent expert on classical Chinese philosophy, was of the opinion that no direct connections could be assumedNor, despite the fundamental similarity of the symbolic ideas, does there need to be any direct influence, since the ideas, as experience shows and as I think I have demonstrated, arise autochthonously again and again, independently of one another, out of a psychic matrix that seems to be ubiquitous.
As a counterpart to the Lamaic mandala, I now reproduce the Tibetan World Wheel, which should be sharply distinguished from the former, since it represents the worldIn the centre are the three principles: cock, snake, and pig, symbolizing lust, envy, and unconsciousnessThe wheel has, near the centre, six spokes, and twelve spokes round the edgeIt is based on a triadic systemThe wheel is held by the god of death, Yama(Later we shall meet other shield-holders: Figs and .) It is understandable that the sorrowful world of old age, sickness, and death should be held in the claws of the death-demonThe incomplete state of existence is, remarkably enough, expressed by a triadic system, and the complete (spiritual) state by a tetradic systemThe relation between the incomplete and the complete state therefore corresponds to the sesquitertian proportion of  : This relation is known in Western alchemical tradition as the axiom of MariaIt also plays a not inconsiderable role in dream symbolism.
We shall now pass on to individual mandalas spontaneously produced by patients in the course of an analysis of the unconsciousUnlike the mandalas so far discussed, these are not based on any tradition or model, seeming to be free creations of fantasy, but determined by certain archetypal ideas unknown to their creatorsFor this reason the fundamental motifs are repeated so often that marked similarities occur in drawings done by the most diverse patientsThe pictures come as a rule from educated persons who were unacquainted with the ethnic parallelsThe pictures differ widely, according to the stage of the therapeutic process; but certain important stages correspond to definite motifsWithout going into therapeutic details, I would only like to say that a rearranging of the personality is involved, a kind of new centringThat is why mandalas mostly appear in connection with chaotic psychic states of disorientation or panicThey then have the purpose of reducing the confusion to order, though this is never the conscious intention of the patientAt all events they express order, balance, and wholenessPatients themselves often emphasize the beneficial or soothing effect of such picturesUsually the mandalas express religious, i.e., numinous, thoughts and ideas, or, in their stead, philosophical onesMost mandalas have an intuitive, irrational character and, through their symbolical content, exert a retroactive influence on the unconsciousThey therefore possess a magical significance, like icons, whose possible efficacy was never consciously felt by the patientIn fact, it is from the effect of their own pictures that patients discover what icons can meanTheir pictures work not because they spring from the patients' own fantasy but because they are impressed by the fact that their subjective imagination produces motifs and symbols of the most unexpected kind that conform to law and express an idea or situation which their conscious mind can grasp only with difficultyConfronted with these pictures, many patients suddenly realize for the first time the reality of the collective unconscious as an autonomous entityI will not labour the point here; the strength of the impression and its effect on the patient are obvious enough from some of the pictures.
This mandala was done by a woman patient in her middle years, who first saw it in a dreamHere we see at once the difference from the Eastern mandalaIt is poor in form, poor in ideas, but nevertheless expresses the individual attitude of the patient far more clearly than the Eastern pictures, which have been subjected to a collective and traditional configurationHer dream ran: I was trying to decipher an embroidery patternMy sister knew howI asked her if she had made an elaborate hemstitched handkerchiefShe said, No, but I know how it was done. Then I saw it with the threads drawn, but the work not yet doneOne must go around and around the square until near the centre, then go in circles.
The spiral is painted in the typical colours red, green, yellow, and blueAccording to the patient, the square in the centre represents a stone, its four facets showing the four basic coloursThe inner spiral represents the snake that, like Kundalini, winds three and a half times round the centre.
The dreamer herself had no notion of what was going on in her, namely the beginning of a new orientation, nor would she have understood it consciouslyAlso, the parallels from Eastern symbolism were completely unknown to her, so that any influence is out of the questionThe symbolic picture came to her spontaneously, when she had reached a certain point in her development.
It is, unfortunately, not possible for me to say exactly under what circumstances each of these pictures aroseThat would lead us too farThe sole aim of this paper is to give a survey of the formal parallels to the individual and collective mandalaI regret also that for the same reason no single picture can be interpreted circumstantially and in detail, as that would inevitably require a comprehensive account of the analytical situation of the patientWherever it is possible to shed light on the origins of the picture by a passing hint, as in the present case, I shall do so.
As to the interpretation of the picture, it must be emphasized that the snake, arranged in angles and then in circles round the square, signifies the circumambulation of, and way to, the centreThe snake, as a chthonic and at the same time spiritual being, symbolizes the unconsciousThe stone in the centre, presumably a cube, is the quaternary form of the lapis philosophorumThe four colours also point in this directionIt is evident that the stone in this case signifies the new centre of personality, the self, which is also symbolized by a vessel.
The painter was a middle-aged woman of schizoid dispositionShe had several times drawn mandalas spontaneously, because they always had an ordering effect on her chaotic psychic statesThe picture shows a rose, the Western equivalent of the lotusIn India the lotus-flower (padma) is interpreted by the Tantrists as the wombWe know this symbol from the numerous pictures of the Buddha (and other Indian deities) in the lotus-flowerIt corresponds to the Golden Flower of Chinese alchemy, the rose of the Rosicrucians, and the mystic rose in Dante's ParadisoRose and lotus are usually arranged in groups of four petals, indicating the squaring of the circle or the united oppositesThe significance of the rose as the maternal womb was nothing strange to our Western mystics, for we read in a prayer inspired by the Litany of Loreto:
The rose in the centre is depicted as a ruby, its outer ring being conceived as a wheel or a wall with gates (so that nothing can come out from inside or go in from outside)The mandala was a spontaneous product from the analysis of a male patientIt was based on a dream: The dreamer found himself with three younger travelling companions in LiverpoolIt was night, and rainingThe air was full of smoke and sootThey climbed up from the harbour to the upper city. The dreamer said: It was terribly dark and disagreeable, and we could not understand how anyone could stick it hereWe talked about this, and one of my companions said that, remarkably enough, a friend of his had settled here, which astonished everybodyDuring this conversation we reached a sort of public garden in the middle of the cityThe park was square, and in the centre was a lake or large poolA few street lamps just lit up the pitch darkness, and I could see a little island in the poolOn it there was a single tree, a red-flowering magnolia, which miraculously stood in everlasting sunshineI noticed that my companions had not seen this miracle, whereas I was beginning to understand why the man had settled here.
The dreamer went on: I tried to paint this dreamBut as so often happens, it came out rather differentThe magnolia turned into a sort of rose made of ruby-coloured glassIt shone like a four-rayed starThe square represents the wall of the park and at the same time a street leading round the park in a squareFrom it there radiate eight main streets, and from each of these eight side-streets, which meet in a shining red central point, rather like the Étoile in ParisThe acquaintance mentioned in the dream lived in a house at the corner of one of these stars. The mandala thus combines the classic motifs of flower, star, circle, precinct (temenos), and plan of city divided into quarters with citadelThe whole thing seemed like a window opening on to eternity, wrote the dreamer.
Flower motif with cross in the centreThe square, too, is arranged like a flowerThe four faces at the corners correspond to the four cardinal points, which are often depicted as four deitiesHere they have a demonic characterThis may be connected with the fact that the patient was born in the Dutch East Indies, where she sucked up the peculiar local demonology with the mother's milk of her native ayahHer numerous drawings all had a distinctly Eastern character, and thereby helped her to assimilate influences that at first could not be reconciled with her Western mentality.
In the picture that followed, the demon faces were ornamentally elaborated in eight directionsFor the superficial observer the flowerlike character of the whole may disguise the demonic element the mandala is meant to ward offThe patient felt that the demonic effect came from the European influence with its moralism and rationalismBrought up in the East Indies until her sixth year, she came later into a conventional European milieu, and this had a devastating effect on the flowerlike quality of her Eastern spirit and caused a prolonged psychic traumaUnder treatment her native world, long submerged, came up again in these drawings, bringing with it psychic recovery.
A later stage is shown hereMinute care in the draughtsmanship vies with richness of colour and formFrom this we can discern not only the extraordinary concentration of the patient but the triumph of Eastern flowerlikeness over the demon of Western intellectualism, rationalism, and moralismAt the same time the new centring of the personality becomes visible.
In this painting, done by another young woman patient, we see at the cardinal points four creatures: a bird, a sheep, a snake, and a lion with a human faceTogether with the four colours in which the four regions are painted, they embody four principlesThe interior of the mandala is emptyOr rather, it contains a Nothing that is expressed by a quaternityThis is in accord with the overwhelming majority of individual mandalas: as a rule the centre contains the motif of the rotundum, known to us from alchemy, or the four-fold emanation or the squaring of the circle, or—more rarely—the figure of the patient in a universal human sense, representing the AnthroposWe find this motif, too, in alchemyThe four animals remind us of the cherubim in Ezekiel's vision, and also of the four symbols of the evangelists and the four sons of Horus, which are sometimes depicted in the same way, three with animal heads and one with a human headAnimals generally signify the instinctive forces of the unconscious, which are brought into unity within the mandalaThis integration of the instincts is a prerequisite for individuation.
Painting by an older patientHere the flower is seen not in the basic pattern of the mandala, but in elevationThe circular form has been preserved inside the square, so that despite its different execution this picture can still be regarded as a mandalaThe plant stands for growth and development, like the green shoot in the diaphragm chakra of the kundalini yoga systemThe shoot symbolizes Shiva and represents the centre and the male, whereas the calyx represents the female, the place of germination and birthThus the Buddha sitting in the lotus is shown as the germinating godIt is the god in his rising, the same symbol as Ra the falcon, or the phoenix rising from the nest, or Mithras in the tree-top, or the Horus-child in the lotusThey are all symbolizations of the status nascendi in the seeding-place of the matrixIn medieval hymns Mary too is praised as the cup of the flower in which Christ, coming down as a bird, makes his nestPsychologically Christ means unity, which clothes itself in the corpus mysticum of the Church or in the body of the Mother of God (mystic rose), surrounded as with flower-petals, and thus reveals itself in realityChrist as an image is a symbol of the selfJust as the plant stands for growth, so the flower depicts the unfolding from a centre.
Here the four rays emanating from the centre spread across the whole pictureThis gives the centre a dynamic characterThe structure of the flower is a multiple of fourThe picture is typical of the marked personality of the patient, who had some artistic talent(She also painted Fig.) Besides that she had a strong feeling for Christian mysticism, which played a great role in her lifeIt was important for her to experience the archetypal background of Christian symbolism.
Photograph of a rug woven by a middle-aged woman, Penelope-like, at a time of great inner and outer distressShe was a doctor and she wove this magic circle round herself, working at it every day for months, as a counterbalance to the difficulties of her lifeShe was not my patient and could not have been influenced by meThe rug contains an eight-petalled flowerA special feature of the rug is that it has a real above and below. Above is light; below, relative darknessIn it, there is a creature like a beetle, representing an unconscious content, and comparable with the sun in the form of KheperaOccasionally the above and below are outside the protective circle, instead of insideIn that case the mandala affords protection against extreme opposites; that is, the sharpness of the conflict is not yet realized or else is felt as intolerableThe protective circle then guards against possible disruption due to the tension of opposites.
An Indian picture of Shiva-bindu, the unextended pointIt shows the divine power before the creation: the opposites are still unitedThe god rests in the pointHence the snake signifies extension, the mother of Becoming, the creation of the world of formsIn India this point is also called Hiranyagarbha, golden germ' or golden egg.' We read in the Sanatsugatiya: That pure great light which is radiant, that great glory which the gods worship, which makes the sun shine forth, that divine, eternal Being is perceived by the faithful.
This picture, also by a middle-aged woman patient, shows the squaring of the circleThe plants again denote germination and growthIn the centre is a sunAs the snake-and-tree motif shows, we have here a conception of ParadiseA parallel is the Gnostic conception of Edem with the four rivers of Paradise in the Naassene gnosisFor the functional significance of the snake in relation to the mandala, see the preceding paper (comments on pictures , , and ).
This picture was painted by a neurotic young womanThe snake is somewhat unusual in that it lies in the centre itself, its head coinciding with thisUsually it is outside the inner circle, or at least coiled round the central pointOne suspects (rightly, as it turned out) that the inner darkness does not conceal the longed-for unity, the self, but rather the chthonic, feminine nature of the patientIn a later picture the mandala bursts and the snake comes out.
The picture was done by a young womanThis mandala is legitimate in so far as the snake is coiled round the four-rayed middle pointIt is trying to get out: it is the awakening of Kundalini, meaning that the patient's chthonic nature is becoming activeThis is also indicated by the arrows pointing outwardsIn practice it means becoming conscious of one's instinctual natureThe snake in ancient times personified the spinal ganglia and the spinal cordArrows pointing outwards may in other cases mean the opposite: protection of the inside from danger.
Drawn by an older patientUnlike the previous picture, this one is introverted. The snake is coiled round the four-rayed centre and has laid its head on the white, central point (Shiva-bindu), so that it looks as if it were wearing a haloThere seems to be a kind of incubation of the middle point—the motif of the snake guarding the treasureThe centre is often characterized as the treasure hard to attain.
Done by a middle-aged womanThe concentric circles express concentrationThis is further emphasized by the fishes circumnavigating the centreThe number  has the meaning of total concentrationThe movement to the left presumably indicates movement towards the unconscious, i.e., immersion in it.
This is a parallel to Figure : sketch of a fish-motif which I saw on the ceiling of the Maharajah's pavilion in Benares.
A fish instead of a snakeFish and snake are simultaneously attributes of both Christ and the devilThe fish is making a whirlpool in the sea of the unconscious, and in its midst the precious pearl is being formedA Rig-Veda hymn says:
As a rule the snake personifies the unconscious, whereas the fish usually represents one of its contentsThese subtle distinctions must be borne in mind when interpreting a mandala, because the two symbols very probably correspond to two different stages of development, the snake representing a more primitive and more instinctual state than the fish, which in history as well was endowed with higher authority than the snake (cfthe Ichthys-symbol).
In this picture by a young woman the fish has produced a differentiated centre by circumnavigation, and in it a mother and child stand before a stylized Tree of Life or of KnowledgeHere the fish has a dragonlike nature; it is a monster, a sort of Leviathan, which, as the texts from Ras Shamra show, was originally a snakeOnce more the movement is to the left.
The golden ball corresponds to the golden germ (Hiranyagarbha)It is rotating, and the Kundalini winding round it has doubledThis indicates conscious realization, since a content rising out of the unconscious splits at a certain moment into two halves, a conscious and an unconscious oneThe doubling is not made by the conscious mind, but appears spontaneously in the products of the unconsciousThe rightwards rotation, expressed by the wings (swastika-motif), likewise indicates conscious realizationThe stars show that the centre has a cosmic structureIt has four rays, and thus behaves like a heavenly bodyThe Shatapatha-Brahmana says:
Then he looks up to the sun, for that is the final goal, that the safe resortTo that final goal, to that resort he goes; for this reason he looks up to the sun.
He looks up, saying, Self-existent art thou, the best ray of light! The sun is indeed the best ray of light, and therefore he says, Self-existent art thou, the best ray of light! Light-bestowing art thou: give me light (varkas)! So say I, said Yajñavalkya, and for this indeed the Brahmin should strive, if he would be brahmavarkasin, illumined by brahma.
He then turns from left to right, saying, I move along the course of the sun. Having reached that final goal, that safe resort, he now moves along the course of yonder sun.
This sun has seven raysA commentator remarks that four of them point to the four quarters; one points upwards, another downwards, but the seventh and best points inwardsIt is at the same time the sun's disc, named HiranyagarbhaThis, according to Ramanuja's commentary on the Vedanta Sutras, is the highest self, the collective aggregate of all individual souls. It is the body of the highest Brahma and represents the collective psycheFor the idea of the self as compounded of many, compare Origen's Each of us is not one, but many and All are righteous, but one receiveth the crown.
The patient was a woman of sixty, artistically giftedThe individuation process, long blocked but released by the treatment, stimulated her creative activity (Fig derives from the same source) and gave rise to a series of happily coloured pictures which eloquently express the intensity of her experience.
Done by the same patientShe herself is shown practising contemplation or concentration on the centre: she has taken the place of the fish and the snakesAn ideal image of herself is laid round the precious eggThe legs are flexible, like a nixie'sThe psychology of such a picture reappears in ecclesiastical traditionThe Shiva-Shakti of the East is known in the West as the man encompassed by a woman, Christ and his bride the ChurchCompare the Maitrayana-Brahmana Upanishad:
He the Self is also he who warms, the Sun, hidden by the thousand-eyed golden egg, as one fire by anotherHe is to be thought after, he is to be sought afterHaving said farewell to all living things, having gone to the forest, and having renounced all sensuous objects, let a man perceive the Self from his own body.
Here too the radiation from the centre spreads out beyond the protective circle into the distanceThis expresses the idea of the far-reaching effect of the introverted state of consciousnessIt could also be described as an unconscious connection with the world.
This picture was done by another middle-aged patientIt shows various phases of the individuation processDown below she is caught in a chthonic tangle of roots (the mūlādhāra of kundalini yoga)In the middle she studies a book, cultivating her mind and augmenting her knowledge and consciousnessAt the top, reborn, she receives illumination in the form of a heavenly sphere that widens and frees the personality, its round shape again representing the mandala in its Kingdom of God aspect, whereas the lower, wheel-shaped mandala is chthonicThere is a confrontation of the natural and spiritual totalitiesThe mandala is unusual on account of its six rays, six mountain peaks, six birds, three human figuresIn addition, it is located between a distinct Above and Below, also repeated in the mandala itselfThe upper, bright sphere is in the act of descending into the hexad or triad and has already passed the rim of the wheelAccording to old tradition the number  means creation and evolution, since it is a coniunctio of  and  (even and odd = female and male)Philo Judaeus therefore calls the senarius () the number most suited to generation. The number , he says, denotes the surface or flatness, whereas  means height or depthThe quaternarius shows the nature of solids, whereas the three first numbers characterize or produce incorporeal intelligencesThe number  appears as a three-sided pyramidThe hexad shows that the mandala consists of two triads, and the upper one is making itself into a quaternity, the state of equability and justice, as Philo saysDown below lurk unintegrated dark cloudsThis picture demonstrates the not uncommon fact that the personality needs to be extended both upwards and downwards.
These mandalas are in part atypicalBoth were done by the same young womanIn the centre, as in the previous mandala, is a female figure, as if enclosed in a glass sphere or transparent bubbleIt looks almost as if an homunculus were in the makingIn addition to the usual four or eight rays, both mandalas show a pentadic elementThere is thus a dilemma between four and fiveFive is the number assigned to the natural man, in so far as he consists of a trunk with five appendagesFour, on the other hand, signifies a conscious totalityIt describes the ideal, spiritual man and formulates him as a totality in contrast to the pentad, which describes the corporeal manIt is significant that the swastika symbolizes the ideal man, whereas the five-pointed star symbolizes the material and bodily manThe dilemma of four and five corresponds to the conflict between culture and nature. That was the problem of the patientIn Figure  the dilemma is indicated by the four groups of stars: two of them contain four stars and two of them five starsOn the rims of both mandalas we see the fire of desire. In Figure  the rim is made of something that looks like lighted tissueIn characteristic contrast to the shining mandala, both these (especially the second one) are burning. It is flaming desire, comparable to the longing of the homunculus in the retort (Faust, Part II), which was finally shattered against the throne of GalateaThe fire represents an erotic demand but at the same time an amor fati that burns in the innermost self, trying to shape the patient's fate and thus help the self into realityLike the homunculus in Faust, the figure shut up in the vessel wants to become.
The patient was herself aware of the conflict, for she told me she had no peace after painting the second pictureShe had reached the afternoon of her life, and was in her thirty-fifth yearShe was in doubt as to whether she ought to have another childShe decided for a child, but fate did not let her, because the development of her personality was evidently pursuing a different goal, not a biological but a cultural oneThe conflict was resolved in the interests of the latter.
Picture by a middle-aged manIn the centre is a starThe blue sky contains golden cloudsAt the four cardinal points we see human figures: at the top, an old man in the attitude of contemplation; at the bottom, Loki or Hephaestus with red, flaming hair, holding in his hands a templeTo the right and left are a light and a dark female figureTogether they indicate four aspects of the personality, or four archetypal figures belonging, as it were, to the periphery of the selfThe two female figures can be recognized without difficulty as the two aspects of the animaThe old man corresponds to the archetype of meaning, or of the spirit, and the dark chthonic figure to the opposite of the Wise Old Man, namely the magical (and sometimes destructive) Luciferian elementIn alchemy it is Hermes Trismegistus versus Mercurius, the evasive trickster. The circle enclosing the sky contains structures or organisms that look like protozoaThe sixteen globes painted in four colours just outside this circle derived originally from an eye motif and therefore stand for the observing and discriminating consciousnessSimilarly, the ornaments in the next circle, all opening inwards, are rather like vessels pouring out their content towards the centreOn the other hand the ornaments along the rim open outwards, as if to receive something from outsideThat is, in the individuation process what were originally projections stream back inside and are integrated into the personality againHere, in contrast to Figure , Above and Below, male and female, are integrated, as in the alchemical hermaphrodite.
Once again the centre is symbolized by a starThis very common image is consistent with the previous pictures, where the sun represents the centreThe sun, too, is a star, a radiant cell in the ocean of the skyThe picture shows the self appearing as a star out of chaosThe four-rayed structure is emphasized by the use of four coloursThis picture is significant in that it sets the structure of the self as a principle of order against chaosIt was painted by the same man who did Figure .
This mandala, by an older woman patient, is again split into Above and Below: heaven above, the sea below, as indicated by the golden waves on a green groundFour wings revolve leftwards about the centre, which is marked only by an orange-red spotHere too the opposites are integrated and are presumably the cause of the centre's rotation.
An atypical mandala, based on a dyadA golden moon and a silver moon form the upper and lower edgesThe inside is blue sky above and something like a black crenellated wall belowOn it there sits a peacock, fanning out its tail, and to the left there is an egg, presumably the peacock'sIn view of the important role which the peacock and the peacock's egg together play in alchemy and also in Gnosticism, we may expect the miracle of the cauda pavonis, the appearance of all Colours (Böhme), the unfolding and realization of wholeness, once the dark dividing wall has broken down(See Fig.) The patient thought the egg might split and produce something new, maybe a snakeIn alchemy the peacock is synonymous with the PhoenixA variant of the Phoenix legend relates that the Semenda Bird consumes itself, a worm forms from the ashes, and from the worm the bird rises anew.
This picture is reproduced from the Codex Alchemicus Rhenoviensis, Central Library, ZurichHere the peacock represents the Phoenix rising newborn from the fireThere is a similar picture in a manuscript in the British Museum, only there the peacock is enclosed in a flask, the vas hermeticum, like the homunculusThe peacock is an old emblem of rebirth and resurrection, quite frequently found on Christian sarcophagiIn the vessel standing beside the peacock the colours of the cauda pavonis appear, as a sign that the transformation process is nearing its goalIn the alchemical process the serpens mercurialis, the dragon, is changed into the eagle, the peacock, the goose of Hermes, or the Phoenix.
This picture was done by a seven-year-old boy, offspring of a problem marriageHe had done a whole series of these drawings of circles and hung them up round his bedHe called them his loves and would not go to sleep without themThis shows that the magical pictures still functioned for him in their original sense, as a protective magic circle.
An eleven-year-old girl, whose parents were divorced, had, at a time of great difficulties and upsets, drawn a number of pictures which clearly reveal a mandala structureHere too they were magic circles intended to stop the difficulties and adversities of the outside world from entering into the inner psychic spaceThey represent a kind of self-protection.
As on the kilkhor, the Tibetan World Wheel (Fig), you can see at either side of this picture something that looks like horns, which as we know belong to the devil or to one of his theriomorphic symbolsThe slanting eye-slits underneath them, and the two strokes for nose and mouth, are also the devil'sThis amounts to saying: Behind the mandala lurks the devilEither the demons are covered up by the magically powerful picture, and thereby eliminated—which would be the purpose of the mandala—or, as in the case of the Tibetan World Wheel, the world is caught in the claws of the demon of deathIn this picture the devils merely peek out over the edgeI have seen what this means from another case: An artistically gifted patient produced a typical tetradic mandala and stuck it on a sheet of thick paperOn the back there was a circle to match, filled with drawings of sexual perversionsThis shadow aspect of the mandala represented the disorderly, disruptive tendencies, the chaos that hides behind the self and bursts out in a dangerous way as soon as the individuation process comes to a standstill, or when the self is not realized and so remains unconsciousThis piece of psychology was expressed by the alchemists in their Mercurius duplex, who on the one hand is Hermes the mystagogue and psychopomp, and on the other hand is the poisonous dragon, the evil spirit and trickster.
Drawing by the same girlRound the sun is a circle with eyes, and round this an uroborosThe motif of polyophthalmia frequently occurs in individual mandalas(See Picture  and Fig in the preceding paper.) In the Maitrayana-Brahmana Upanishad VI,  the egg (Hiranyagarbha) is described as thousand-eyed. The eyes in the mandala no doubt signify the observing consciousness, but it must also be borne in mind that the texts as well as the pictures both attribute the eyes to a mythic figure, e.g., an Anthropos, who does the seeingThis seems to me to point to the fascination which, through a kind of magical stare, attracts the attention of the conscious mind(CfFigs and .)
Painting of a medieval city with walls and moats, streets and churches, arranged quadraticallyThe inner city is again surrounded by walls and moats, like the Imperial City in PekingThe buildings all open inwards, towards the centre, represented by a castle with a golden roofIt too is surrounded by a moatThe ground round the castle is laid with black and white tiles, representing the united oppositesThis mandala was done by a middle-aged man (cfFigs, , )A picture like this is not unknown in Christian symbolismThe Heavenly Jerusalem of Revelation is known to everybodyComing to the Indian world of ideas, we find the city of Brahma on the world mountain, MeruWe read in the Golden Flower: The Book of the Yellow Castle says: In the square inch field of the square foot house, life can be regulated.' The square foot house is the faceThe square inch field in the face: what could that be other than the heavenly heart? In the middle of the square inch dwells the splendourIn the purple hall of the city of jade dwells the God of Utmost Emptiness and Life.
Painted by the same patient who did Figures  and Here the seeding-place is depicted as a child enclosed in a revolving sphereThe four wings are painted in the four basic coloursThe child corresponds to Hiranyagarbha and to the homunculus of the alchemistsThe mythologem of the Divine Child is based on ideas of this sort.
Mandala in rotation, by the same patient, who did Figures  and A notable feature is the quaternary structure of the golden wings in combination with the triad of three dogs running round the centreThey have their backs to it, indicating that for them the centre is in the unconsciousThe mandala contains—another unusual feature—a triadic motif turning to the left, while the wings turn to the rightThis is not accidentalThe dogs represent consciousness scenting or intuiting the unconscious; the wings show the movement of the unconscious towards consciousness, as corresponded to the patient's situation at the timeIt is as if the dogs were fascinated by the centre although they cannot see itThey seem to represent the fascination felt by the conscious mindThe picture embodies the above-mentioned sesquitertian proportion ( : ).
The same motif as before, but represented by haresFrom a Gothic window in the cathedral at PaderbornThere is no recognizable centre though the rotation presupposes one.
Picture by a young woman patientIt too exhibits the sesquitertian proportion and hence the dilemma with which Plato's Timaeus begins, and which as I said plays a considerable role in alchemy, as the axiom of Maria.
This picture was done by a young woman patient with a schizoid dispositionThe pathological element is revealed in the breaking lines that split up the centreThe sharp, pointed forms of these breaking lines indicate evil, hurtful, and destructive impulses which might hinder the desired synthesis of personalityBut it seems as if the regular structure of the surrounding mandala might be able to restrain the dangerous tendencies to dissociationAnd this proved to be the case in the further course of the treatment and subsequent development of the patient.
A neurotically disturbed mandalaIt was drawn by a young, unmarried woman patient at a time that was full of conflict: she was in a dilemma between two menThe outer rim shows four different coloursThe centre is doubled in a curious way: fire breaks out from behind the blue star in the black field, while to the right a sun appears, with blood vessels running through itThe five-pointed star suggests a pentagram symbolizing man, the arms, legs, and head all having the same valueAs I have said, it signifies the purely instinctual, chthonic, unconscious man(CfFigs and .) The colour of the star is blue—of a cool nature, thereforeBut the nascent sun is yellow and red—a warm colourThe sun itself (looking rather like the yolk of an incubated egg) usually denotes consciousness, illumination, understandingHence we could say of this mandala: a light is gradually dawning on the patient, she is waking out of her formerly unconscious state, which corresponded to a purely biological and rational existence(Rationalism is no guarantee of higher consciousness, but merely of a one-sided one!) The new state is characterized by red (feeling) and yellow or gold (intuition)There is thus a shifting of the centre of personality into the warmer region of heart and feeling, while the inclusion of intuition suggests a groping, irrational apprehension of wholeness.
This picture was done by a middle-aged woman who, without being neurotic, was struggling for spiritual development and used for this purpose the method of active imaginationThese efforts induced her to make a drawing of the birth of a new insight or conscious awareness (eye) from the depths of the unconscious (sea)Here the eye signifies the self.
Drawing of motif from a Roman mosaic on the floor of a house in Moknine, Tunis, which I photographedIt represents an apotropaism against the evil eye.
Mandala from the Navaho Indians, who with great toil prepare such mandalas from coloured sand for curative purposesIt is part of the Mountain Chant Rite performed for the sickAround the centre there runs, in a wide arc, the body of the Rainbow GoddessA square head denotes a female deity, a round one a male deityThe arrangement of the four pairs of deities on the arms of the cross suggests a swastika wheeling to the rightThe four male deities who surround the swastika are making the same movement.
Another sand-painting by the Navahos, from the Male Shooting ChantThe four horned heads are painted in the four colours that correspond to the four directions.
Here, for comparison, is a painting of the Egyptian Sky Mother, bending, like the Rainbow Goddess, over the Land with its round horizonBehind the mandala stands—presumably—the Air God, like the demon in Figures  and Underneath, the arms of the ka, raised in adoration and decked with the eye motif, hold the mandala, which probably signifies the wholeness of the Two Lands.
This picture, from a manuscript of Hildegard of Bingen, shows the earth surrounded by the ocean, realm of air, and starry heavenThe actual globe of the earth in the centre is divided into four.
Böhme has a mandala in his book XL Questions concerning the Soule (see Fig of preceding paper)The periphery contains a bright and a dark hemisphere turning their backs to one anotherThey represent un-united opposites, which presumably should be bound together by the heart standing between themThis drawing is most unusual, but aptly expresses the insoluble moral conflict underlying the Christian view of the worldThe Soul, Böhme says, is an Eye in the Eternal Abyss, a similitude of Eternity, a perfect Figure and Image of the first Principle, and resembles God the Father in his Person, as to the eternal NatureThe Essence and Substance of it, merely as to what it is purely in itself, is first the wheel of Nature, with the first four Forms. In the same treatise Böhme says: The substance and Image of the soul may be resembled to the Earth, having a fair flower growing out of it… The Soul is a fiery Eye … from the eternal Centre of Nature … a similitude of the First Principle. As an eye, the soul receives the Light, as the Moon does the glance of the Sun … for the life of the soul has its original in the Fire.
Figure  is especially interesting because it shows us very clearly in what relationship the picture stands to the painterThe patient (the same as did Fig) has a shadow problemThe female figure in the picture represents her dark, chthonic sideShe is standing in front of a wheel with four spokes, the two together forming an eight-rayed mandalaFrom her head spring four snakes, expressing the tetradic nature of consciousness, but—in accordance with the demonic character of the picture—they do this in an evil and nefarious way, since they represent evil and destructive thoughtsThe entire figure is wrapped in flames, emitting a dazzling lightShe is like a fiery demon, a salamander, the medieval conception of a fire spriteFire expresses an intense transformation processHence the prima materia in alchemy was symbolized by the salamander in the fire, as the next picture showsThe spear- or arrow-head expresses direction: it is pointing upwards from the middle of the headEverything that the fire consumes rises up to the seat of the godsThe dragon glowing in the fire becomes volatilized; illumination comes through the fiery tormentFigure  tells us something about the background of the transformation processIt depicts a state of suffering, reminiscent on the one hand of crucifixion and on the other of Ixion bound to the wheelFrom this it is evident that individuation, or becoming whole, is neither a summum bonum nor a summum desideratum, but the painful experience of the union of oppositesThat is the real meaning of the cross in the circle, and that is why the cross has an apotropaic effect, because, pointed at evil, it shows evil that it is already included and has therefore lost its destructive power.
This picture was done by a sixty-year-old woman patient with a similar problem: A fiery demon mounts through the night towards a starThere he passes over from a chaotic into an ordered and fixed stateThe star stands for the transcendent totality, the demon for the animus, who, like the anima, is the connecting link between conscious and unconsciousThe picture recalls the antique symbolism found, for instance, in Plutarch: The soul is only partly in the body, the other part is outside it and soars above man like a star symbolizing his genius. The same conception can be found among the alchemists.
Picture by the same patient as before, showing flames with a soul rising up from them, as if swimmingThe motif is repeated in Figure Exactly the same thing—and with the same meaning—can be found in the Codex Rhenoviensis (fifteenth century), Zurich (Fig)The souls of the calcined prima materia escape as vapours, in the form of human figures looking like children (homunculi)In the fire is the dragon, the chthonic form of the anima mundi, which is being transmuted.
Here I must remark that not only did the patient have no knowledge of alchemy but that I myself knew nothing at that time of the alchemical picture materialThe resemblance between these two pictures, striking as it is, is nothing extraordinary, since the great problem and concern of philosophical alchemy was the same as underlies the psychology of the unconscious, namely individuation, the integration of the selfSimilar causes (other things being equal) have similar effects, and similar psychological situations make use of the same symbols, which on their side rest on archetypal foundations, as I have shown in the case of alchemy.
I hope I have succeeded in giving the reader some idea of mandala symbolism with the help of these picturesNaturally my exposition aims at nothing more than a superficial survey of the empirical material on which comparative research is basedI have indicated a few parallels that may point the way to further historical and ethnic comparisons, but have refrained from a more complete and more thorough exposition because it would have taken me too far.
I need say only a few words about the functional significance of the mandala, as I have discussed this theme several times beforeMoreover, if we have a little feeling in our fingertips we can guess from these pictures, painted with the greatest devotion but with unskilful hands, what is the deeper meaning that the patients tried to put into them and express through themThey are yantras in the Indian sense, instruments of meditation, concentration, and self-immersion, for the purpose of realizing inner experience, as I have explained in the commentary to the Golden FlowerAt the same time they serve to produce an inner order—which is why, when they appear in a series, they often follow chaotic, disordered states marked by conflict and anxietyThey express the idea of a safe refuge, of inner reconciliation and wholeness.
I could produce many more pictures from all parts of the world, and one would be astonished to see how these symbols are governed by the same fundamental laws that can be observed in individual mandalasIn view of the fact that all the mandalas shown here were new and uninfluenced products, we are driven to the conclusion that there must be a transconscious disposition in every individual which is able to produce the same or very similar symbols at all times and in all placesSince this disposition is usually not a conscious possession of the individual I have called it the collective unconscious, and, as the bases of its symbolical products, I postulate the existence of primordial images, the archetypesI need hardly add that the identity of unconscious individual contents with their ethnic parallels is expressed not merely in their form but in their meaning.
Knowledge of the common origin of these unconsciously preformed symbols has been totally lost to usIn order to recover it, we have to read old texts and investigate old cultures, so as to gain an understanding of the things our patients bring us today in explanation of their psychic developmentAnd when we penetrate a little more deeply below the surface of the psyche, we come upon historical layers which are not just dead dust, but alive and continuously active in everyone—maybe to a degree that we cannot imagine in the present state of our knowledge.
The Sanskrit word mandala means circle in the ordinary sense of the wordIn the sphere of religious practices and in psychology it denotes circular images, which are drawn, painted, modelled, or dancedPlastic structures of this kind are to be found, for instance, in Tibetan Buddhism, and as dance figures these circular patterns occur also in Dervish monasteriesAs psychological phenomena they appear spontaneously in dreams, in certain states of conflict, and in cases of schizophreniaVery frequently they contain a quaternity or a multiple of four, in the form of a cross, a star, a square, an octagon, etcIn alchemy we encounter this motif in the form of quadratura circuli.
In Tibetan Buddhism the figure has the significance of a ritual instrument (yantra), whose purpose is to assist meditation and concentrationIts meaning in alchemy is somewhat similar, inasmuch as it represents the synthesis of the four elements which are forever tending to fall apartIts spontaneous occurrence in modern individuals enables psychological research to make a closer investigation into its functional meaningAs a rule a mandala occurs in conditions of psychic dissociation or disorientation, for instance in the case of children between the ages of eight and eleven whose parents are about to be divorced, or in adults who, as the result of a neurosis and its treatment, are confronted with the problem of opposites in human nature and are consequently disoriented; or again in schizophrenics whose view of the world has become confused, owing to the invasion of incomprehensible contents from the unconsciousIn such cases it is easy to see how the severe pattern imposed by a circular image of this kind compensates the disorder and confusion of the psychic state—namely, through the construction of a central point to which everything is related, or by a concentric arrangement of the disordered multiplicity and of contradictory and irreconcilable elementsThis is evidently an attempt at self-healing on the part of Nature, which does not spring from conscious reflection but from an instinctive impulseHere, as comparative research has shown, a fundamental schema is made use of, an archetype which, so to speak, occurs everywhere and by no means owes its individual existence to tradition, any more than the instincts would need to be transmitted in that wayInstincts are given in the case of every newborn individual and belong to the inalienable stock of those qualities which characterize a speciesWhat psychology designates as archetype is really a particular, frequently occurring, formal aspect of instinct, and is just as much an a priori factor as the latterTherefore, despite external differences, we find a fundamental conformity in mandalas regardless of their origin in time and space.
The squaring of the circle is one of the many archetypal motifs which form the basic patterns of our dreams and fantasiesBut it is distinguished by the fact that it is one of the most important of them from the functional point of viewIndeed, it could even be called the archetype of wholenessBecause of this significance, the quaternity of the One is the schema for all images of God, as depicted in the visions of Ezekiel, Daniel, and Enoch, and as the representation of Horus with his four sons also showsThe latter suggests an interesting differentiation, inasmuch as there are occasionally representations in which three of the sons have animals' heads and only one a human head, in keeping with the Old Testament visions as well as with the emblems of the seraphim which were transferred to the evangelists, and—last but not least—with the nature of the Gospels themselves: three of which are synoptic and one Gnostic. Here I must add that, ever since the opening of Plato's Timaeus (One, two, three … but where, my dear Socrates, is the fourth?) and right up to the Cabiri scene in Faust, the motif of four as three and one was the ever-recurring preoccupation of alchemy.
The profound significance of the quaternity with its singular process of differentiation extending over the centuries, and now manifest in the latest development of the Christian symbol, may explain why Du chose just the archetype of wholeness as an example of symbol formationFor, just as this symbol claims a central position in the historical documents, individually too it has an outstanding significanceAs is to be expected, individual mandalas display an enormous varietyThe overwhelming majority are characterized by the circle and the quaternityIn a few, however, the three or the five predominates, for which there are usually special reasons.
Whereas ritual mandalas always display a definite style and a limited number of typical motifs as their content, individual mandalas make use of a well-nigh unlimited wealth of motifs and symbolic allusions, from which it can easily be seen that they are endeavouring to express either the totality of the individual in his inner or outer experience of the world, or its essential point of referenceTheir object is the self in contradistinction to the ego, which is only the point of reference for consciousness, whereas the self comprises the totality of the psyche altogether, i.e., conscious and unconsciousIt is therefore not unusual for individual mandalas to display a division into a light and a dark half, together with their typical symbolsAn historical example of this kind is Jakob Böhme's mandala, in his treatise XL Questions concerning the SouleIt is at the same time an image of God and is designated as suchThis is not a matter of chance, for Indian philosophy, which developed the idea of the self, Atman or Purusha, to the highest degree, makes no distinction in principle between the human essence and the divineCorrespondingly, in the Western mandala, the scintilla or soul-spark, the innermost divine essence of man, is characterized by symbols which can just as well express a God-image, namely the image of Deity unfolding in the world, in nature, and in man.
The fact that images of this kind have under certain circumstances a considerable therapeutic effect on their authors is empirically proved and also readily understandable, in that they often represent very bold attempts to see and put together apparently irreconcilable opposites and bridge over apparently hopeless splitsEven the mere attempt in this direction usually has a healing effect, but only when it is done spontaneouslyNothing can be expected from an artificial repetition or a deliberate imitation of such images.
